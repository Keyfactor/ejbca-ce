        This build file contains deprecation checks for EJBCA. These may be
        obsoleted properties, ant targets, or anything else the user should be
        aware of.

        The main purpose is to warn the users about the removal of those
        features/functionalities in the following release so they can update
        their property files or their procedures in a timely manner.

        Once the item has been deprecated in one release of EJBCA, in the next
        release it should be moved from here to the removed list (in removed.xml
        build file), and set-up in such a way that it'll fail a build (using the
        "fail" ant task).
