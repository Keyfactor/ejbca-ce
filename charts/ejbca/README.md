## Helm Chart for EJBCA

Helm chart for deploying EJBCA in Kubernetes. Designed to be simple and flexible.

EJBCA covers all your needs – from certificate management, registration and enrollment to certificate validation.

Welcome to EJBCA – the Open Source Certificate Authority (software). EJBCA is one of the longest running CA software projects, providing time-proven robustness, reliability and flexibitlity. EJBCA is platform independent and can easily be scaled out to match the needs of your PKI requirements, whether you’re setting up a national eID, securing your industrial IoT platform or managing your own internal PKI for Enterprise or DevOps.

EJBCA is developed in Java and runs on a JVM such as OpenJDK, available on most platforms such as Linux and Windows.

There are two versions of EJBCA:
* **EJBCA Community** (EJBCA CE) - free and open source, OSI Certified Open Source Software
* **EJBCA Enterprise** (EJBCA EE) - commercial and Common Criteria certified

OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.
