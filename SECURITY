
EJBCA SECURITY
==============

NOTE!
Security is CRITICAL for a CA. Protection of the CAs private key is esential, since compromise of the CAs private key will let anyone issue false certificates, which can be used to gain access to systems relying on the CA for authentication and other security services.
After realising this, please read on and take a pragmatic approach to security suitable for your policy, application and environment.

Configuring for security
------------------------
The easiest way to keep the installation secure is to block all JBOSS ports (1099, 1476, 4444, 8082, 8083) from the outside and only allow traffic to Tomcat ports (8080).
This is because the public end-user actions can be performed through the public servlets, while administration tasks are performed directly on the beans.

See http://www.jboss.org/online-manual/HTML/ch11s03.html for a list of ports used in JBOSS.
See http://www.jboss.org/online-manual/HTML/ch13s84.html for information about security in JBOSS/EJB.
See http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2001/jw-0831-jaas_p.html for more examples about setting up role-permissions.
See http://www.jboss.org/online-manual/HTML/ch13s12.html on how to set up SSL with JBOSS/Tomcat.

For more advanced security configurations utilizing Bean permissions as defined below, security must be activated in JBoss. To activate security in JBoss see the JBoss manual at:
http://www.jboss.org/online-manual/HTML/ch09.html

BEAN PERMISSIONS
----------------

Below is a list describing the access permissions that should apply on all beans and their methods.
internalUser means that the method should not be available to the public, only internally to administrator interfaces and other beans and servlets running on the server.

Bean permissions are set in the 'ejb-jar.xml' files.
CA BEAN
=======

RSASignSession
--------------
CreateCRL() must be protected and should only be possible to run from internalUser.
All other methods are public.

AuthenticationSession
---------------------
All methods are protected and can only be accessed from the RSASignSession (internalUser).

CertificateStoreSession
-----------------------
storeCertificate() is protected and can only be accessed from internalUser.
storeCRL() is protected and can only be accessed from internalUser.
All other methods are public.

CreateCRLSession
----------------
All methods are protected and can only be accessed from the internalUser, i.e. cronjob running timely.

CertificateDate
---------------
All methods are protected and can only be accessed from the internalUser.

CRLData
-------
All methods are protected and can only be accessed from the internalUser.

RA BEAN
=======

UserAdminSession
----------------
All methods are protected and can only be accessed from the internalUser.


UserData
--------
All methods are protected and can only be accessed from the internalUser.
