# ------------ OCSP responder configuration ---------------------
# These configurations are used both for EJBCA and the Validation Authority (VA).
#
# These values are used for OCSP responses signed by a CA and as defaults for delegated OCSP signing by OcspKeyBindings.
# Certificate Profile or URL specific configuration here will still override the configured values of an OcspKeyBinding.

# OCSP servlet enabled. If false there will be no servlet.
# Default is true.
#ocsp.enabled=false

# Context root (the path in the URL)
# Default is '/${app.name}/publicweb/status'
#ocsp.contextroot=/status

# DEPRECATED VALUE
# Deprecated since 6.2.4. The current value will be used to perform upgrade at first startup, and may be removed afterwards. 
#
# Specifies the subject of a certificate which is used to identify the 
# responder which will generate responses when no real CA can be found from the request. 
# This is used to generate 'unknown' responses when a request is received for a certificate 
# that is not signed by any CA on this server. Recommended to use same as ca.dn.
#
# For the internal OCSP responder this is the subject DN of the CA to use for signing
# For an external OCSP responder this is the issuer DN of the OCSP responders certificate to use for signing, i.e. the CAs subject DN.
ocsp.defaultresponder=CN=ManagementCA,O=EJBCA Sample,C=SE

# If set to false the OCSP responses will only contain the signature certificate (if ocsp.includesignercertinresponse is set to 'true'), 
# and not the whole certificate chain of the OCSP responder.
# Default true.
#ocsp.includecertchain=true

# If set to false, the  OCSP response will not contain the signing certificate.
# Default true 
#ocsp.includesignercert=true

# Specifies which signature algorithms should be used on OCSP responses. You can specify several algorithm
# separated by ';'. If RSA keys are used in the OCSP signing certificate, the algorithm with RSA will be used, and
# if ECDSA keys are used in the OCSP signing certificate, the algorithm with ECDSA will be used and if 
# DSA keys are used in the OCSP signing certificate, the algorithm with DSA will be used.
#
# Default: SHA1WithRSA;SHA1WithECDSA;SHA1WithDSA
#ocsp.signaturealgorithm=SHA1WithRSA;SHA1WithECDSA;SHA1WithDSA

# The interval on which the the OCSP signing certificates are updated in seconds.
# If set to 0 or negative these certificate are never updated.
# Default: 300
#ocsp.signingCertsValidTime=0

# When a signing certificate is about to expire a WARN message could be written to log4j each time the key of the certificate is used.
# This property defines when this message is started to be written.
# The property is set to the number of seconds before the expiration that the WARN message starts to be written.
# If set to 0 the warning is disabled.
# Default: 604800 (1 week)
#ocsp.warningBeforeExpirationTime=10000

# If true a certificate that does not exist in the database, but is issued by a CA the responder handles
# will be treated as not revoked. Default (when value is false) is to treat is as "unknown". Since the OCSP responders database normally contains all issued certificate
# this gives sensible values (in line with RFC6960) to "ok", "revoked" and "unknown" certificates.
#
# Setting this value to true is useful if you want an External OCSP responder database to only contain revoked certificates, and not
# all certificates. In this case the responder will answer "ok" to requests for certificates that do not exist in the database. 
# If both 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood' and 'ocsp.nonexistingisrevoked' are set to 'true', the responder will answer "ok".
#
# Note that for standard OCSP responders this value is set in the keybinding, so this configuration value acts as a default for CAs. 
#
# Default: false
#ocsp.nonexistingisgood=false

# Setting this value to true will cause CAs to respond with an unsigned "Unauthorized" response for unknown serial numbers. 
#
# Setting this value to true is not compatible with ocsp.nonexistingisgood or ocsp.nonexistingisrevoked
#
# Note that for standard OCSP responders this value is set in the keybinding, so this configuration value acts as a default for CAs. 
#
# Default: false
#ocsp.nonexistingisunauthorized=false

# The value of 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood=false' may be overridden if the URL that the client used to send the request is matching some regular expression.
# The regular expressions that if any of them is fulfilled will override 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood=false' is numbered from 1 and up. It may be any numbers.
# Here follows an example of 2:
#ocsp.nonexistingisgood.uri.1=.*/thisEndingIsGood$
#ocsp.nonexistingisgood.uri.2=^http://good.myhost.nu:8080/.*

# The value of 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood=true' may be overridden if the URL that the client used to send the request is matching some regular expression.
# The regular expressions that if any of them is fulfilled will override 'ocsp.nonexistingisgood=true' is numbered from 1 and up. It may be any numbers.
# Here follows an example of 2:
#ocsp.nonexistingisbad.uri.1=.*/thisEndingIsBad$
#ocsp.nonexistingisbad.uri.2=^http://bad.myhost.nu:8080/.*

# If true a certificate that does not exist in the database, but is issued by a CA the responder handles,
# will be treated as revoked; the revocation reason will be "Certificate Hold" and the revocation time is January 1st, 1970 (compliant with RFC6960). 
# Default (when this value and value of "Non existing is good" are false) is to treat it as "unknown".
# If both "Non existing is good" and "Non existing is revoked", the responder will answer "ok".
#
# Note that for standard OCSP responders this value is set in the keybinding, so this configuration value acts as a default for CAs. 
#
# Default: false
#ocsp.nonexistingisrevoked=false

# The value of 'ocsp.nonexistingisrevoked=false' may be overridden if the URL that the client used to send the request is matching some regular expression.
# The regular expressions that if any of them is fulfilled will override 'ocsp.nonexistingisrevoked=false' is numbered from 1 and up. It may be any numbers.

#ocsp.nonexistingisrevoked.uri.1=.*/thisEndingIsRevoked$
#ocsp.nonexistingisrevoked.uri.2=^http://revoked.myhost.nu:8080/.*

# An OCSP responder MAY choose to retain revocation information beyond a certificate's expiration.  The date obtained by subtracting this
# retention interval value from the producedAt time in a response is defined as the certificate's "archive cutoff" date.
# To illustrate, if a server is operated with a 7-year retention interval policy and status was produced at time t1, then the value
# for ArchiveCutoff in the response would be (t1 - 7 years).
#
# OCSP-enabled applications would use an OCSP archive cutoff date to contribute to a proof that a digital signature was (or was not)
# reliable on the date it was produced even if the certificate needed to validate the signature has long since expired
# The value of this configuration should be set to the number of seconds of this retention interval. To disable the archive cutoff extension, 
# the value of this configuration should be set to '-1'
#
# Default: 31536000 (1 year)
#ocsp.expiredcert.retentionperiod = 31536000
#ocsp.expiredcert.retentionperiod = -1
