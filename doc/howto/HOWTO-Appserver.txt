CONFIGURING Weblogic
====================

Note: EJBCA should work fine with Weblogic 7.x/8.x/9.x

1. Edit ejbca.properties, it's important to at least set up the database parameters.
Make special note to:
datasource.jndi-name-prefix - which is specific for Weblogic.
weblogic-oracle-columntype - which is specific for Weblogic.
httpserver.privhttps=7002 - default SSL port of Weblogic is 7002, default of EJBCA on JBoss is 8443.

If you had issued an 'ant' command before, it is now important to do 'ant clean' before building again.

Also edit bin/cli.xml and remove the comments for the two weblogic lines.

2. If you are using Oracle go into file src/java/se/anatom/ejbca/log/LogEntryDataBean.java and change
a line above the method 'getComment()' according to the documentation there.

3. Create EJBCA domain with weblogic configuration wizard, select Basic weblogic server domain, Express,
   Development mode, sun's JDK at bea's home directory, and remember the admin username/password.
   
4. Create EjbcaPool and EjbcaDS in Weblogic, the JNDI name should be the one specified in ejbca.properties.
Create tables in the database configured for EjbcaPool and EjbcaDS in Weblogic.
- You can do an 'ant bootstrap' to JBoss if you want JBoss to create the tables for you.

See the file create-tables-ejbca3.sql for table definitions, or just run /doc/howto/create-tables-ejbca3-oracle.sql for Oracle.

5.Create a new java mail session for user notification in UserAdminSessionBean. In Weblogic, the JNDI name should be "EjbcaMail".
  key in the properties:
  mail.store.protocol=pop3
  mail.transport.protocol=smtp
  mail.user=icejean
  mail.pop3.host=pop.21cn.com
  mail.smtp.host=smtp.21cn.com
  mail.smtp.auth=false
  mail.from=icejean@21cn.com
  mail.debug=false
  
6. Set the environment variable WEBLOGIC_HOME pointing to for example /bea/weblogic81 
(weblogic.jar is located under WEBLOGIC_HOME/server/lib).

7. Unforturnately you must also point JBOSS_HOME to where JBoss is located in order for the build 
script to work, at least until someone provides a weblogic.xml corresponding to bin/jboss.xml.

8. Deploy the ear file in weblogic, it should works straight away.

7. Edit 'jndi.properties' in the directories 'ejbca/bin' and 'ejbca/src/java' to
call Weblogic instead of JBoss, modify the principal and credentials according to you weblogic 
domain's setting (same as the user name/password to login weblogic console).

8. Run 'ant install' to do the installation.

10. Configure SSL in Weblogic:
a) Copy %JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts to %BEA_HOME%/jre/lib/security, so that Weblogic can trust the initial CA installed 
when doing 'ant install', you can get the cert with 'bin/ejbca.sh ca getrootcert cert.pem'.
b) Configure weblogic server for SSL.
   server->configuration->keystore&ssl, click "Change", select "Custom Identity and Java Standard Trust"
     Custom Identity Keystore: path to tomcat.jks generated while "ant isntall",
     Private Key Alias: localhost
     Passphrase: serverpwd, specified in ejbca.properties.
 
   server->configuration->keystore&ssl->advanced options->Server Attributes->Two Way Client Cert Behavior:
     Client Certs Requested And Enforced

   server->configuration->general, check "SSL Listen Port Enabled", note that the port should be same as httpserver.privhttps in ejbca.properties.

11.Copy %EJBCA_HOME%/src/adminweb/languages/*.* to /tmp/languages/*.* , where /tmp should be at the same disk with weblogic,
   d:\ for example, as org.ejbca.ui.web.admin.configuration.WebLanguages.init() has a bug of reading those property files
   within the servlet context on weblogic. Need to be addressed in the future.
   
This should make the admin-GUI work, note to install the  Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files from java.sun.com 
for both sun's JDK and BEA's JDK first before installation.
If installing with Oracle, perhaps you need to replace jdbc driver at weblogic_home\server\lib, weblogic_home\server\ext\jdbc\oracle\920, 10g 
all to 10.1.0.2, in my case which is Oracle 9.2.0.

TransactionTimeoutException in Weblogic
---------------------------------------
If you are running on a not-so-fast machine, you may experience TransationTimeoutException during 'ant install'.
This is due to that it takes a long time for RSA key generation.

To configure the transaction timeout to a larger value in weblogic:
1. logon to Weblogic Console with IE, for example, http://localhost:7001/console
2. click "Services" at the left "Domain Structure" navigation frame to expand the service list.
3. click "JTA" to display the JTA property setting page at right content frame.
4. update the first property "Timeout Seconds" to a ratinal value that is enough to execute EJBCA installation
   (about 100s to finish the whole installation).


JBOSS
=====

JBoss commonly have problems with class loading if several applications are run in one instance of JBoss.
This will typically manifest itself as ClassCast-, IllegalAccess- or VerifyError Exceptions. 
The reason is usually that mora than one application is using an external jar file, for example commons-fileupload.jar
or ldap.jar, possibly using different versions as well.

These links describe how to configure jboss-app.xml, etc and also describe how
JBoss classloading works.
