Set up a database for EJBCA in JBoss
====================================

The following databases have in some stage been tested with EJBCA:

* Hypersoniq (hsqldb) (default in JBoss)
* PostegreSQL 7.2 and 8.x (http://www.postgresql.org/)
* MySQL 4.x and 5.x (http://www.mysql.com/)
* Oracle 8i, 9i and 10g (http://www.oracle.com/)
* Sybase
* MS-SQL2000, 2003, 2008
* DB2
* Informix 9.2
* Derby
* Ingres 9.3

Unless you are adventurous and know what you're doing, it is recommended to define
another datasource for ejbca and not reconfigure DefaultDS with another database
as you run the risk to jump into mapping bugs in the JBoss configuration and mess
up your server default configuration.

If all is well the automatic deployment script of EJBCA will configure all that for
you and you will be up and running in 30 seconds.
Configuration is done in conf/database.properties.

In a production environment you should use something else than the default Hypersonic database that comes 
with JBoss for the reasons:
1. Hypersonic database is in-memory, which means that over time it will consume more memory. If a large
numer of certificates is issued, it will become an issue after a while.
2. Hypersonic does not support full SQL, in particular ALTER statements. When a new version of EJBCA is 
released we can not create scripts that updates the database if some tables changed. This will make 
upgrades much much harder.

If you will be running a huuuge system you will probably need to run some analysis tools to perfect indexes
etc in the database, at least in the long run. Examples of such tools are:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqa/

NOW ON TO THE HOWTO!

Troubleshooting database problems:
---------------------------------
* Have you (ejbca automatically does it) configured a <database-ds.xml> in JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy?
  Configuration is done in conf/database.properties.
* Do you have the correct username/password configured in <database-ds.xml>?
  Configuration is done in conf/database.properties.
* Is the JDBC driver installed in JBOSS_HOME/server/default/lib?
* Does you database accept incoming connection from the network, not only localhost or vice versa?
* Do you have a firewall blocking connections to the database?
* Can you connect to the database from another machine?
* Use ip-address instead of hostname in <database-ds.xml> (DNS problems?)

Configuring EJBCA
-----------------

0. Use 'ant clean' to clean up your repository if not already done.

1. Edit 'conf/database.properties' and follow the instructions to change the default values.
   Specify the 'datasource.jndi-name' to the one you chose.
   For example: 'EjbcaDS'

   There is a database.properties.sample that is heavily commented.

2. Use 'ant deploy', it will configure automatically all deployment descriptors such
   as ejb-jar.xml, jbosscmp-jdbc.xml, according to the database/jndi-name you chose before.

  It will also copy ejbca-ds.xml to ${jboss.home}/server/default/deploy.
  This file defines your database configuration such as the driver, url, username, password.
  All other parameters are optional, so don't bother with them unless you know what you're doing.
  Of course this ejbca-ds.xml should define the jndi-name as 'EjbcaDS' (or whatever name you chose
  in the previous step)

  If something is wrong, you should see it in the logs of your application server

XDoclet merge files for database specific table and column configurations are in src/deploy/ejb/merge/<database name>.

Configuring JBoss
-----------------

NOTE:

If you are using the default database HSQLDB: Nothing should be done, just install
JBoss and run.

The following is only if you want to replace the default database with another for EJBCA.

The description given here is for JBoss 3.x. Consider consulting the
official JBoss documentation.

Database configuration files in JBoss are located in the
<jboss-home>/server/default/deploy. EJBCA automatically deploys a new datasource
definition file in JBoss, so you don't have to do anything with that.

1. Install and setup the database your database.

2. Create a database for EJBCA (that is obviously the one you defined in conf/database.properties)
Check your database documentation for more info (I know it is boring).

Typically for postgres: 'createdb ejbca "database for ejbca"' will create
a database named 'ejbca' with description "database for ejbca" and with user postgres (add '-E UTF8' for utf8 encoding if not default).
To create a new user for the ejbca database 'createuser -P ejbca'
Then you may have to mess around a lot to be able to connect to the database as well...
for example change in pg_hba.conf to not use ident for logins to the local database, so you can actually connect locally as the ejbca user.

Typically for mysql: 'mysqladmin create ejbca' will create the database. 
Start 'mysql -u root mysql' and create the user with "grant all on ejbca.* to ejbca@'<host>' identified by '<pwd>';".

3. Put the JDBC driver for the database in <jboss-home>/server/default/lib/ (or replace default if you are running 
   another JBoss target, perhaps all?).

4. DONE! Start JBoss. Run tests with 'ant test:run'.
   Use your favorite database graphic editor to look at the beautiful database tables.

Hardening
---------
When using logging you probably do not want an attacker to be able to remove log posts, therefore you should limit the
table rights on ProtectedLogData, ProtectedLogTokenData and LogEntryData.

MySQL specifics
---------------
EJBCA have been tested with MySQL 3, 4 and 5.

JDBC driver: mysql-connector-java-5.0.x.jar.
(use the latest mysql connection you can get for your mysql version)

Download JDBC driver for mySQL from http://www.mysql.com/

Sometimes there can be problems with MySQL related to case sensitivity of database tables.
If you run into this see:
http://mysqld.active-venture.com/Name_case_sensitivity.html
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/name-case-sensitivity.html

To use UTF-8 encoding in the database, which may be nessecary to get your national characters to work, you may have to 
use the following option to the mysql connect string:
jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/ejbca?characterEncoding=UTF-8

There are also lots of settings that you can do in my.cnf:
 character-set-server=utf8
 default-collation=utf8_unicode_ci
 default-character-set=utf8
maybe you need them all, maybe you don't need any of them...try you way forward (starting with nothing) and
try to add stuff if it doesn't work.

The SQL command to show tables in MySQL is:
show tables;

To limit the table rights to ProtectedLogData, ProtectedLogTokenData and LogEntryData:
Configure and run $EJBCA_HOME/doc/howto/mysql-privileges.sh to generate an .sql file with the new database privileges.
After the .sql file is generated you have to run:
#mysql -u ejbca -p ejbca < <path to the generated .sql file>
#mysql -u root -p
mysql> flush privileges;
Restart jboss

If you use JDBC-driver 3.1.x you may have to add "?useServerPrepStmts=false" to the database connect url in 
conf/database.properties, i.e.:
#database.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/ejbca?useServerPrepStmts=false
You will need this if you get errors with "Incorrect arguments to mysql_stmt_execute" when doing install of EJBCA.
This problem seems to affect the combination of MySQL 4.x with Connector/J 3.1.x.

PostgreSQL specifics
--------------------
EJBCA have been tested with PostgreSQL 7.x and 8.x.

JDBC driver: 
For v7.x the 7.4 driver is needed to support the JDBC used by JBoss.
For v8.x the 8.1 driver works fine.

Download JDBC driver for PostgreSQL from http://jdbc.postgresql.org/.

Sample setup:
 admin@host:~$ sudo su postgres
 postgres@host:~$ createuser -SDRP ejbca
  <enter password twice>
 postgres@host:~$ createdb ejbca

Oracle specifics
----------------
Note that the default Oracle JDBC driver for Oracle 8 and 9 is seriously flawed and will not update 
BLOBS larger than a certain size. EJBCA uses some BLOBs, so unforturnately is doesn't work.
The driver from Oracle 10 works fine and can be downloaded from:
http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/index.html

The JDBC-driver from http://www.datadirect.com/ also works fine, but it's not for free.

JDBC driver: ojdbc14.zip 

Use latest driver from at least Oracle 10 that can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/.
We also had reports that some version of the Oracle 10 driver does not work, but that the driver 
from Oracle 9.2i works. Since oracles JDBC driver seems to be of such bad quality, we have to 
recommend that you try different versions until you find one that works...or use another database.
Version 10.1.0.4.0 is confirmed to work.

The SQL command to show tables in Oracle is:
select table_name from user_tables;


MS-SQL specifics
----------------
Microsofts JDBC driver:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/MSDN-FILES/027/001/779/msdncompositedoc.xml&frame=true

There is also an open source JDBC driver at:
http://jtds.sourceforge.net/
This driver is not tested by us (yet), but it has received very good reviews as beeing much better than Microsofts
driver, so I suggest you take it for a spin.


DB2 specifics
----------------
DB2 Express 9.1.2 and Enterprise 9.1 has been tested.

IBMs JDBC driver for DB2 is named "db2jcc.jar" or "db2jcc_license_c.jar".

1. DB2 does not manage users, so DB2 users have to be local's or ldap's. We create a system user
called "ejbca" to be used by DB2.
2. Login as db2inst1 ("su - db2inst1"). Type db2cc, it will launch the administration control center
of DB2.
3. Choose your DB2 server and your instance db2inst1 and the Databases directory
(http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/8499/snapshot1yt1.png)
4. Create a new database named "EJBCA" (http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/9127/snapshot2jz9.png) and
the rest default.
5. Create a new Schema for the EJBCA database (http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/8136/snapshot3up8.png)
with "EJBCA" as "Schema Name" and "EJBCA" as "Authorization name".
(http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/9907/snapshot4sh9.png)
6. Create a new BufferPool "BP16K" with SIZE 2500 and PAGESIZE 16K.
7. Create a new Tablespace "EJBCADB_DATA_01" with PAGESIZE 16K, EXTENTSIZE 32 and PREFETCHSIZE 32.
8. Verify that that your temporary tablespace (e.g. TEMPSPACE1) uses a bufferpool
(e.g. IMBDEFAULTBP or BP16K) with a page size of 16K.
9. Configure EJBCA_HOME/conf/database.properties and install EJBCA.

Using "Select Tools→Command Editor", 6 & 7 would look something like this:
    CREATE BUFFERPOOL "BP16K" SIZE 2500 PAGESIZE 16384 NOT EXTENDED STORAGE;
    CONNECT RESET;
    CONNECT TO EJBCA;
    CREATE REGULAR TABLESPACE EJBCADB_DATA_01 IN DATABASE PARTITION
    GROUP IBMDEFAULTGROUP PAGESIZE 16384 MANAGED BY DATABASE USING
    (FILE '/home/db2inst1/db2inst1/EJBCA/ejbcadb_data_01.dbf'512000) EXTENTSIZE 32
    PREFETCHSIZE 32 BUFFERPOOL BP16K OVERHEAD 7.500000
    TRANSFERRATE 0.060000 FILE SYSTEM CACHING DROPPED TABLE RECOVERY ON;
'512000' here is not the size of the table space in pages, so 512000*16384 equal 7.9 Gb. You can
add more space for your database by selecting the tablespace "EJBCA_DATA_01", click on
"Alter Tablespace", then click on "Containers", then select the only container and click on
"Change..." and now change the value of the container size
(http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/8379/snapshot7ve3.png).

On DB2 you have a database, a schema id and a table name. The default database properties works,
because when you don't specify a schema id, the userid is used. But you can specify the schema name
in the connection string: 
    database.url=jdbc:db2://bigfatiron.foo.com:5021/DB2T:currentSchema=EJBCA;
    
Earlier DB2 documentation for EJBCA suggest changes in standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml, but this does not
seem to be neccessary with the latest EJBCA on DB2 9.1.2 Express Edition. Especially the BLOB(2000)
change is solved by explicit CMP mapping. Old doc follows:

The size of the constraints names have a limit of 18 characters in DB2, so it is required to unset
the automatic naming of the constraints at the creation of the scheme by EJBCA under JBOSS. It is
also required to increase the size limit columns of type BLOB to 200000 bytes in the creation of
the schema by EJBCA under JBOSS. Indeed under DB2 the size limit  columns of type BLOB created is
2000 bytes which is insufficient for storing data inserted by EJBCA.

To do those change, it is necessary to modify the file
$HOME_JBOSS/server/default/conf/standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml which describe the behavior of driver's
database. The DB2 section have to be changed like this :
      ...
      <type-mapping>
         <name>DB2</name>
         <!--
         | This type-mapping applies to DB2 V7.2 and V8.0
         -->
         <row-locking-template/>
         <pk-constraint-template>PRIMARY KEY (?2)</pk-constraint-template>
         <fk-constraint-template>ALTER TABLE ?1 ADD CONSTRAINT ?2 FOREIGN KEY (?3) REFERENCES ?4 (?5)</fk-constraint-template>
         <alias-header-prefix>t</alias-header-prefix>
         <alias-header-suffix>_</alias-header-suffix>
         <alias-max-length>18</alias-max-length>
         <subquery-supported>true</subquery-supported>
         <true-mapping>1</true-mapping>
         <false-mapping>0</false-mapping>
      ...
      </type-mapping>


  
Informix specifics
------------------
EJBCA have been tested Informix Dynamic Server 9.21.HC4
JDBC Driver: IBM Informix JDBC Driver for IBM Informix Dynamic Server 3.00.JC3

The default mapping in JBoss, InformixDB, does not work for Informix 9.2, so you should use Informix92 in conf/database.properties and do the following:
Add the mappings from doc/howto/informix-jbossmappings.txt to JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml.

Some Informix database modifications need to be done to be able to insert
BLOB and TEXT data (which is required by EJBCA):
You must generate a dbspace of the SmartBlobSpace kind for storing the
TEXT data type attributes. This require the generation of a Unix RAW
filesystem and then create the sbspace. After that, change the database
configuration to recognize the new data space.

Informix JDBC driver:
http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/product.jsp?id=MCOS-5MKKAB&s=z&cat=&S_TACT=TrialsAndBetas&S_CMP=


Derby specifics
---------------
JavaDB has a command-line utility called "ij" (ij is actually generic
and may be used with any compliant JDBC driver), and you may use
general open source tools like SQuirreL SQL
(http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/).

When creating tables in Derby, they get case sensitiva if you quote them, CREATE TABLE "UserData".

Ij started like this:
    java -jar db-derby-10.2.1.3-bin/lib/derbyrun.jar ij
in JavaDB 10.2, and like this
    java -cp db-derby-10.1.3.1-bin/lib/derby.jar:db-derby-10.1.3.1-b in/lib/derbytools.jar org.apache.derby.tools.ij
in JavaDB 10.1

You can also run directly from glassfish like this:
> export DERBY_INSTALL=/home/sun/glassfish
> cd /home/sun/glassfish/bin
> ../javadb/frameworks/NetworkServer/bin/ij.ksh

Sample run of ij:
ij version 10.1
ij> connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/ejbca;create=true';
ij> run '/home/tomas/dev/workspace/ejbca/doc/howto/create-tables-ejbca3-derby.sql';
ij> select tablename from sys.systables;

Ingres specifics
------------------
EJBCA has been tested with JBoss 4.2.3 together with Ingres DB 9.3

Since Ingres 9.3 and earlier versions do not support boolean you will have to apply the patch 
'ingres9.3.patch' before you build and install EJBCA. Ingres 10 and later will support boolean
so it may work unpatched.

Look in http://community.ingres.com/wiki/Using_JBoss_with_Ingres for a good guide on how to
configure Ingres with JBoss. But rather than using the mapping file refered to in that guide
(standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml) unzip ingres_jbosscmp-jdbc.zip from this directory and copy the
extracted file to: {JBOSS_HOME}/server/default/conf

We also recommend setting DBMS cache on 16k pages to on.
Also make 16k pages default before creating the ejbca database or set it manually when creating
the database by using the command:
  > createdb ejbca -page_size=16384



Indexes for higher performance
==============================

This is a starting point for collecting indexes to create in the database to optimize performance (and cpu and disc usage):
(you can start messing with this when you notice some slowdown, for normal installations it's rarely needed)

Indexes are listed as a script in create-index-ejbca3.sql.
You can run this script to boost your database performance, if you have many record.

Indexes are in MySQL syntax, it should be general enough though.

On external OCSP responders you should create the following two indexes:
create index protect_idx1 on TableProtectData (dbKey,dbType);
create index certificatedata_idx1 on CertificateData (issuerDN,serialNumber);

Indexes for extra security
==========================

In a PKI every issuerDN, serialNumber pair must be unique. That means that a CA can not issue two certificates
with the same serialNumber. The default installation has a very, very, very small chance that that can occur.
SerialNumber are 64 bit random numbers, so the chance of a collision should be virtually nil, unless you issue
billions of certificates. In any case, the index over (issuerDN, serialNumber) on CertificateData assures that 
even this slim chance will never occur.

Note that this is the same index as for performance, and that it is unique.
