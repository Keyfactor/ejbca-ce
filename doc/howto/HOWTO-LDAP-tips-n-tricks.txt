OpenLDAP replication
--------------------

From OpenLDAP news group:

I tried to set up classic replication with my openldap servers, I had some success, 
however I wasn't able to get control over replication as I can with syncrepl module. 
After some days trying, I dropped the idea of classic replication, and moved to syncrepl
module, and I strongly recommend it.

On upstream:
######
overlay syncprov
syncprov-checkpoint 5 3
syncprov-sessionlog 100
######

and on downstream(s):
#####
syncrepl
        rid=123
        provider=ldap://aa.bb.cc.dd:389/
        bindmethod=simple
        binddn="cn=master-superuser,dc=uk"
        credentials=secretpassword
        type=refreshAndPersist
        searchbase="dc=uk"
        schemachecking=on
        interval=00:00:02:00
        retry="60 +"
        scope=sub
        attributes="*"
############

and that's all  :)  and it works fine  :)  One should also note, that user specified on downstream, 
should have implicit read rights for specified replication base dn, like this:

on upstream:

access to *
        by dn="cn=master-superuser,dc=uk" read

see man slapd.conf for explanation of syncrepl configuration options.

Using SerialNumber in LDAP DN
-----------------------------

Modify /etc/ldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema and add serialNumber as a MAY attribute.
After restarting slapd you can now construct an LDAP DN like:
 serialNumber=12345,dc=company,dc=com
This may be useful if you use serialNumber as the unique identifyer in your DNs.

# The inetOrgPerson represents people who are associated with an
# organization in some way.  It is a structural class and is derived
# from the organizationalPerson which is defined in X.521 [X521].
