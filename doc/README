Documentation
-------------
The main documentation for EJBCA is contained in XML format in the xdocs subdirectory.
You can build nice looking html pages from this by running 
  ant doc
from the ejbca home directory (EJBCA_HOME). This will produce the same site as displayed on http://www.ejbca.org/ 
(or an earlier or later version).
The docs will be located in EJBCA_HOME/tmp/htdocs.
The User's Guide is in the file xdocs/manual.xml.

In the subdirectories there hides some other docs:
- xdocs contains the main xml documentation distributed with ejbca, build into html as noted above.
- howto contains howtos for various things, such as databases, application servers, smart card login etc.
- ldapschema contains an addition to the standard ldap schema in order to support devices with certificates.
- licenses contains the license for EJBCA and depending projects.
- samples contains some sample code that does not fit on the source tree
- developer contains architecture documents and information for developers.

There is also a good batch of documentation at http://wiki.ejbca.org/

Installation
------------
Follow the installation instructions in the User's Guide, either built above, or from http://www.ejbca.org/.

PDF
---
A good set of commands to generate a nice PDF version of the User's Guide is:
 ant doc
 apt-get install htmldoc
 htmldoc --footer "  /"  --toclevels 4 -t pdf14 tmp/htdocs/adminguide.html -f adminguide.pdf
 htmldoc --footer "  /"  --toclevels 4 -t pdf14 tmp/htdocs/userguide.html -f userguide.pdf

You can fix the look of the document by removing a h1 header and moving (replace) h3->h1, h4->h2 and h5 to h3.
