Documentation
-------------
The main documentation for EJBCA is contained in XML format in the xdocs subdirectory.
You can build nice looking html pages from this by running 
  ant doc
from the ejbca home directory (EJBCA_HOME). This will produce the same site as displayed on http://www.ejbca.org/ 
(or an earlier or later version).
The docs will be located in EJBCA_HOME/tmp/htdocs.
The User's Guide is in the file xdocs/manual.xml.

In the subdirectories there hides some other docs:
- xdocs contains the main xml documentation distributed with ejbca, build into html as noted above.
- howto contains howtos for various things, such as databases, application servers, smart card login etc.
- ldapschema contains an addition to the standard ldap schema in order to support devices with certificates.
- licenses contains the license for EJBCA and depending projects.
- samples contains some sample code that does not fit on the source tree
- developer contains architecture documents and information for developers.

There is also a good batch of documentation at http://wiki.ejbca.org/

Installation
------------
Follow the installation instructions in the User's Guide, either built above, or from http://www.ejbca.org/.

PDF
---
A good set of commands to generate a nice PDF version of the Admin and User Guide is:
 apt-get install htmldoc
 ant doc
 cd tmp/htdocs/docs
 htmldoc --no-links --footer "  /"  --toclevels 4 -t pdf14 adminguide.html -f adminguide.pdf
 htmldoc --no-links --footer "  /"  --toclevels 4 -t pdf14 userguide.html -f userguide.pdf

You can make a nice, deliverable, document by:
- replace all <h3> with <h2> and </h3> with </h2>
- Edit <pre> formatted text commands for line breaks by adding "\" and a space as first char on the next line.
  These commands work very good to copy-paste into a Linux shell.
  You have to go through the documents manually to fix these, it should take ~1h for both. 
- "EJBCA support, development and maintenance by PrimeKey" needs the <img> removed, and put "PrimeKey" in text instead.
- The Title is too long and should be named something like this instead "EJBCA Enterprise v6.3.0 - User Guide".

Open question:
- Is it possible to add our logo somewhere?
