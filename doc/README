SECURITY
========
Security is discussed below in the chapter about configuration and in
 *SECURITY*.
Please take a minute to thorougly consider the security implications and make
 sure you know what you are doing when you are setting up a CA.

If running on Linux, you should consider using the sample firewall script
provided in 'ejbcafirewall.sh'. If running on Windows, a similar aproach should
be taken with some firewall software.

DEPENDENCIES
============

For ease of installation most dependencies are distributed with EJBA.
The minimal requirements to download and install are JBoss and Ant.

Bouncycastle
------------
For cryptography and creation of certificates and CRLs, EJBCA uses the OpenSource 
JCE crypto provider from Bouncy Castle (http://www.bouncycastle.org).
The provider is distributed with EJBCA as 'jce-jdk13-<version>.jar. The latest
 version of the JCE provider can always be obtained from Bouncy Castle.

OpenLDAP
--------
OpenLDAP is an Open Source LDAP directory which can be obtained from 
http://www.openldap.org. This jar fil is needed by EJBCA to store certificates 
and CRLs in LDAP directories. The jar is redistributed with EJBCA. 
See doc/LICENSE-JLDAP for license conditions of OpenLDAP.

PLATFORMS
=========
EJBCA is completely written in Java and should as such run on any platform where
 a J2EE server runs.
Development and testing is performed on Linux and Windows 2000 platforms.

QUICK START GUIDE
=================

Build
=====
Needed to build and run are:
JDK (1.4.x, also works with 1.3.1_x)
JBOSS 3.x (with Tomcat or Jetty)
Ant 1.4.x to build (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/)
(Bouncycastle JCE provider, distributed with EJBCA see above)

Simply unpack the archive in a directory and run "ant" to build everything.

Set the environment variable JBOSS_HOME to the directory where JBoss's root is
 (/jboss). This is done so the deploy script will know where files are to be
 copied, they are copied to the $JBOSS_HOME/deploy directory.

Copy the Bouncycastle JCE provider 'lib/jce-jdk13-<version>.jar' and the LDAP
library 'lib/ldap.jar' to the directory $JBOSS_HOME/lib/ext, it will be added to
JBoss's classpath
automatically when JBoss is started.

You can also build javadoc on all APIs used with 'ant javadoc'.

Configure
---------

Now when everything is installed, there are a few things to configure before
 starting JBOSS and running everything.

FOR THE IMPATIENT:

1. Build everything with 'ant'.
2. Deploy EJBCA to JBoss with 'deploy.sh/cmd'.
3. Copy the keystore (src/ca/keyStore/server.p12) to $JBOSS_HOME/conf with 'deploy.cmd/sh keystore'.
4. Start JBoss, jars and wars should be deployed.
5. Run the tests with 'runtest.sh/cmd'.
6. Initialize the CA for operation by running 'ca.sh/cmd init'.

NOTE-1: After running tests with 'runtest.sh/cmd', you might consider deleting the
database since some leftovers are left in the database. Also DO NOT run the
testscripts on a production database since it will revoke all certificates in
the database. 'runtest.sh/cmd should not be run on a production system, only
to test the installation.

NOTE-2: The installed keystore is a demo keystore with DN 'C=SE,O=AnaTom,CN=TestCA'.
You should create a new keystore (see below) if using EJBCA for production purposes.

FOR THE OTHERS:

If another database than the default Hypersonic database (for example mySQL)
 should be used, configure the database to be used in JBoss.
See doc/HOWTO-<database>.txt files for this.

Setting up your own CA:

The CA uses a keystore, which is configured at deployment by editing
 'src/ca/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml'. Of special interest is the 'keyStore' entry,
 which points to the keystore holding the CAs private key and certificate chain.
There are several ways to generate a keystore depending on if the CA is a root
 CA or subordinate to another CA.

Root CA:
run 'ca.sh/bat makeroot' and enter all required parameters.
Ex: 'ca.sh makeroot "C=SE,O=AnaTom,CN=EJBCA" 1024 365 /tmp/server.p12 foo123
will create a root CA with the DN 'C=SE,O=AnaTom,CN=EJBCA'. The keylength is
 1024 bit (RSA) and the validity of the root certificate is 365 days. The CAs
 keystore will be stored in '$JBOSS_HOME/conf/server.p12' and be protected by the password
 'foo123'. Quote the DN  so it is treated as one argument.
Now edit 'src/ca/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml' to reflect the values you entered for
 'keyStore' and 'keyStorePass'. If the keystore is placed in a custom directory, don't
run the command 'deploy.cmd/sh keystore'.

Subordinate CA:
run 'ca.sh/bat makereq' and enter all required parameters.
The result will be a PKCS10 certificate request which must be processed by the
 CA that will certify this subordinate CA.
After the request has been processed by the CA the response can be received.
run 'ca.sh/bat recrep' and enter all required parameters to receive the
 certificate reply sent by the CA certifying this subordinate CA. The
 certificate reply is simply a DER-encoded certificate.
Now edit 'src/ca/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml' to reflect the values you entered for
 'keyStore' and 'keyStorePass'.
EJBCA can process certification requests as well by running 'ca.sh/bat
 processreq' to produce a certification response for subordinate CAs

Initializing CA:
PKIX requires that a CRL always is available even if it is empty. Therefore the
CA must be initialized by running 'ca.sh/cmd init' after the CA keystore has
been created and the CA deployed.
When running 'ca.sh/cmd init' the CA certificate(s) are stored, and published
if any Publishers are configured, and a CRL is created and stored/published.

OBS! Don't forget to configure JBoss for security! See 'security.txt'.
Security is CRITICAL for a CA.

Note that application for certificates only work when the status of a user is
 NEW (one time password thing). The status is set to GENERATED after a
 certificate has been issued. To issue a new certificate, the status must be
 reset to NEW,
which can be done through administration with the RA, 'ra.sh/cmd setuserstatus
 <username> <status>'. For a list of all available statuscodes run 'ra.sh/cmd
 setuserstatus'.

Issue CRLS:
CRLs should be issued regularly. There is a special session bean with JNDI
name 'CreatCRLSession' deployed in order to create CRLs. This bean can be run
with 'jobrunner.sh/cmd'.

jobrunner.sh CreateCRLSession

This job should be scheduled with cron on UNIX (and something else on Windows).
The job should be scheduled to run as often as the CRL period is configured to
in ca/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml (default 24 hours).

Example crontab entry:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/java/jdk1.3.1_01/bin
@daily cd /home/ejbca;/home/ejbca/jobrunner.sh CreateCRLSession;

where '/usr/java/jdk1.3.1_01/bin' is the path to where 'java' can be found.
'/home/ejbca' is where ejbca is installed and 'jobrunner.sh' located.

Deploy
======
After configuration, if you have edited the xml configuration files manually,
please run "ant" to rebuild jars and wars. If you are using a deployment tool,
this may not be needed, consult your documentation for the tool.

Run deploy.sh/cmd to install the EJBs and WARs (they are copied to the
 $JBOSS_HOME/deploy directory).

Run
===

Start JBoss with 'run.sh/bat'. JBoss should start up and deploy our beans and 
servlets without error messages.

Run the testprograms with 'runtests.sh/cmd' and watch the lovely debug output
 and logs in JBoss.

Create User certificates
------------------------
To enroll for certificates using browsers, open
 http://127.0.0.1:8080/apply/index.html (assuming Tomcat/Jetty listens
 to port
 8080) and use the links for your browser.

To enroll for certificates using manual methods (for server certificates for
 example) open
http://127.0.0.1:8080/apply/apply_man.html and fill in the form.

Use the 'ca.sh/cmd' and 'ra.sh/cmd' scripts to administer EJBCA.

Note that application for certificates only work when the status of a user is
NEW (or FAILED or INPROCESS) (one time password thing). The status is set to
GENERATED after a certificate has been issued. To issue a new certificate, the
status must be reset to NEW, which can be done through administration with the
RA, 'ra.sh/cmd setuserstatus <username> <status>'. For a list of all available
statuscodes run 'ra.sh/cmd setuserstatus'.
During batch generation of certificates, users with status NEW or FAILED are
generated. This is due to the if a batch generation for some reason failed,
status is set to FAILED and you can try again after fixing the error.

Create server certificates
--------------------------
The best way to create server certificates is to generate a PKCS12 file for the
server.
To do this:

1. Create user with 'ra.sh/cmd'. DN for a server should have the domain name in
CommonName (CN). Example DN for webserver: "C=SE,O=AnaTom,CN=www.anatom.se", or
for mailserver "C=SE,O=AnaTom,OU=Engineering,CN=mail.anatom.se".

2. To be able to batch-generate certificates, the batch generation program must
have access to the users (servers) password in order to request a certificate on
behalf of the user. Normally the password is stored in hashed form, so the
password must be stored in clear text form by:
ra.sh/cmd setclearpwd <username> <password>

3. Generate private keys and certificates in PKCS12 files by:
batch.sh/cmd

4. Many servers (ex Apache) wants keys and certificates in PEM-format, not
PKCS12. 
To generate PEM-files as well as PKCS12-files, add the parameter '-pem' after the 
'batch.cmd/sh' command. The PEM-files will be stored in a separate subdirectory, 
'pem'. The generated PEM-files can be used with Apache etc, and are NOT protected 
by any password.

Another way is to use openssl to transform a PKCS12 file to PEM-format.

openssl pkcs12 -in <pkcs12-file> -nodes

copy and paste private key to key-file, first certificate to server cert-file
and last certificate to CA cert-file (If your CA is a subordinate CA to another
Root CA, the CA cert-file may need to contain the whole cert chain). Exactly how
your server wants the files is server-dependent.


Create CRLs
-----------
To create a crl a JobRunnerSession bean is running with JNDI name
 'CreateCRLSession'. To run the session and create a CRL,
run 'jobrunner.sh/cmd CreateCRLSession'. This job should be run with regular
 intervals in a production CA, therefore the
job should be launched from CRON. There must be a 'jndi.properties' file in the
 classpath when 'jobrunner.sh' is run.

A new CA should always issue an (empty) CRL. This can be done by running
 'ca.sh/cmd createcrl'.

REFERENCE MANUAL
================

Configuring CA
--------------
Comments are provided in src/ca/ca/META-INT/ejb-jar.xml for all options available
 when configuring the CA. Things that can be configured are:
The CA is modular in that all parts are different session beans which implement
 a specified interface. Another session bean implementing the same interface can
 replace any part ot the CA.
Replaceable session beans are RSASession (interface ISignSession),
 AuthenticationSession (interface IAuthenticationSession),
 CertificateStoreSession (interface ICertificateStoreSession) and
 CreateCRLSession (interface IJobRunnerSession).

Options in RSASession:
-Keystore for the CAs private key and certificate chain.
-Certificate lifetime and extensions. Which certificate extensions should be in
 issued certificates and if they should be critical or not. The default values
 should be good, unless CRLDistributionPoint is desired.

Options in CreateCRLSession:
-CRL lifetime and extensions. Default values should be ok.

Options in AuthenticationSession:
-Authentication module. The CA authenticates certification requests with a
 specified bean implementing the IAuthenticationSession interface. The
 default authentication session authenticates towards a local databes held by
 the RA.
An example is provided in sampleauth of a remoteely operated database where
 communication from the CA to the RA is done with a HTTP-based protocol.
The Authentication module is configured by exchanging the session bean
 'AuthenticationSession'.

Options in CertificateStoreSession:
-Datasource to be used when finding things in the database.

Administrating CA
-----------------
The CA has a command line interface ca.sh/cmd. Options are:

* init - Iniitalizes a CA in the beginning or after a rollover. Stores CA
certificates and publishes first CRL.
* makeroot - creates a new Root CA keystore (only used by Root CA).
Quote the DN (") so it is treated as one argument.
* getrootcert - exports the Root CA certificate to file.
* makereq - generates a certification request for a subCA for sending to a
RootCA. Used to create a keystore for a
subordinate CA. Quote the DN  so it is treated as one argument.
* recrep - used to receive certificates which has been produced as result of
sending a certificate request to a RootCA.
* processreq - processes a certification request for
a subordinate CA and creates  a certification reply.
* createcrl - issues a CRL.
* getcrl - retrieves the latest CRL.
* rolloverroot - used to generate a new RootCA certificate using an existing
keypair. This updates the current RootCA keystore.
(only used by Root CA). When this is used, sub-certificates do not need to be
resigned.
* rolloversub - used to generate a new subCA certificate using an existing
keypair. This updates the current subCA keystore.
When this is used, sub-certificates do not need to be resigned.
* listexpired - List certificates that will expire within a given number of days.

Configuring RA
--------------
Options in UserAdminSession:
-Datasource to be used when finding things in the database.

Administrating RA
-----------------
The RA has a command line interface ra.sh/cmd. Options are:

* adduser - adds a user to the database, after addition a user may apply for a
certificate. If email address is set to 'null', no email is put in certificates.
Quote the DN (") so it is treated as one argument.
* deluser - removes a user from the database, any issued certificates
remain  active and present in the database.
* setpwd - set a new password for a user. The password is stored as a hash in 
the database.
* setclearpwd - set a clear text
password for a user, needed to generate  certificates batch-wise.
* setuserstatus - sets status of a user, users can only apply for certificates
when their status is NEW. finduser - find a user in the database and lists
details.
* listnewusers - lists all users with status NEW.
* listusers - lists users with specified status (give command to see list of
status codes).
* revokeuser - revokes a user and all certificates issued to the user.

Configuring databases
---------------------
The session beans use direct database communication (from a connection pool) in
some cases. In these cases the JNDI name if the Datasource used is configured in
ejb-jar.xml and jaws.xml, (default 'java:/DefaultDS').

Configuring Publishers (LDAP):
To publish certificates and CRLs in an LDAP directory, uncomment the section
for the session bean 'PublisherSession1' in 'ca/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml', and
also the section for method permissions for the same session bean. This will
configure an LDAPPublisherSession so be deployed and when certificates and CRLs
are created. Don't formget to edit parameters to 'PublisherSession1' to match
your LDAP server.
Additional Publishers can be configured by adding new session beans called
'PublisherSession2', 'PublisherSession3', etc to ejb-jar.xml.

Batch creation of certificates
------------------------------
Certificates can be created batch-wise with EJBCA. The class
se.anatom.ejbca.batch.BatchMakeP12 creates PKCS12 keystores for all users
designated as NEW in the local RA database. To be able to batch generate
certificates, the users must be registered with clear text passwords. To set a
clear text password for a user use 'ra.sh/cmd setclearpwd <username>
<password>'.
To generate PKCS12 files for all users with status NEW or FAILED, run
'batch.sh/cmd'. This will generate files for users if their clear text passwords
are NOT null.
Without arguments 'batch' generates PKCS12 files for all NEW or FAILED users.
To generate a PKCS12 file for a specific user, enter command 'batch.cmd/sh <username>'.
Generates PKCS12 files are stored in a subdirectory (to the current directory)
called 'p12'. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.
Make sure this directory is WELL protected, since the information contained
in PCS12 files are secret (private keys).
To generate PEM-files as well as PKCS12-files, add the parameter '-pem' after the 
'batch.cmd/sh' command. The PEM-files generates can be used with Apache etc, and 
are NOT protected by any password.

Fetching certificates and CRLs
------------------------------
Certificates and CRLs can be fetched through the web-interface as defined in
 'webdist/index.html'. They can also be fetched directly from the
 'CertificateStoreSession' session bean.

Other deployment scenarios
--------------------------
EJBCA can be run with servlets and EJBs or only with EJBs. The servlets are only
 a publicly available front-end to the beans. If the CA is deployed integrated
 in another J2EE application, this front-end may not be needed.
The sampleauth servlet (sampleauth.war) is only an example and should never be
deployed in a real production environment.

Troubleshooting
===============
Add Debug output from the console administration commands by replacing:

    log4j.rootCategory=INFO, Console

in the file 'log4j.properties' with:

    log4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, Console

SAMPLES
=======
A collection of samples are in the directory src/java/se/anatom/ejbca/samples.

RemoteAuthentication
--------------------
-AuthResult.java
-RemoteVerifyServlet.java
These files are a sample of a remote user database providing user authentication
 to the CA when the CA is about to generate
a certificate for a user. A remote user database is used by configuring the CA
 to use the 'RemoteAuthenticationSession' instead
of 'LocalAuthenticationSession'.
The sample files implement a simple file based user database and a servlet that
 responds to the HTTP requests comming from the CA.
The sample remote authentication is deployes by deploying the file
 'sampleauth.war' in JBoss.

NullAuthenticationSession
-------------------------
Another sample included is the NullAuthentication (in package
se.anatom.ejbca.ca.auth)
session. This authentication module can be used for demo purposes since it
authenticates any request sent to it and uses the passed in username as DN.
It is easily used simply by exchanging the default AuthenticationSession in
ca/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml for the NullAuthenticationSession.

Programatically get certificate
-------------------------------
-HttpGetCert.java
Example how a certificate can be fetched programmatically using HTTP/S. The
 sample generates a certificate request and uses POST to the same servlet
as used from a browser through
http://127.0.0.1:8080/apply/apply_man.jsp.
The servlet url used in the example is http://127.0.0.1:8080/apply/certreq.
The certificate reply containing a PEM-formatted certificate is printed to the
 screen.

Browser key generation:
http://home.netscape.com/eng/security/comm4-keygen.html

Note on Mozilla certs:
For Netscape/Mozilla to be able to verify client certificates the
 CA-certificates must have the extensions BasicConstraints and
 AuthorityKeyIdentifier.
Client certificates also need AuthorityKeyIdentifier

Note on IE certs:
For IE to verify client certs, the ordering in the DN must be strictly the same
 in both client and CA certs. Possibly that it must also be in a specific order.
