		<section name="EJBCA - The Open Source CA">
			<p>
				EJBCA<sup>&#174;</sup> is a PKI Certificate Authority software, built using Java (JEE) technology. 
				Robust, flexible, high performance, scalable, platform independent, and component based, EJBCA can be used stand-alone or integrated with other applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Extremely scalable and flexible, EJBCA is suitable to build a complete PKI infrastructure for any large enterprise or organization. If you only want to 
				issue a few single certificates for testing, there are probably other options that will get you started quicker, but if you want a serious Certificate Authority 
				to manage your Public Key Infrastructure, we recommend EJBCA. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>EJBCA has everything for your trust center.</strong> Contact us for more info, or look at the extensive <a href="features.html">feature list</a>.
