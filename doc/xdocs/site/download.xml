  <section name="Virtual Machine for Testing">
    <p>
    Get a feeling for, and start testing, EJBCA easily by downloading and running our 
    <a href="https://download.primekey.se/public/ejbcav6ce-vm.zip">EJBCAv6 VM</a>, currently running EJBCA Community 6.10.
    The VM features a full EJBCA Community v6 install, running on WildFly 10 and Java 8, using a <a href="http://www.mariadb.org/" target="_mariadb">MariaDB</a> database backend. 
    It comes with a readme file with instructions and some usage hints. The VM is a 2.5GB VirtualBox OVA, but can easily be converted to run on KVM and VWware<sup>&#174;</sup>. 
    </p><p>The VM should not be used in production as admin keys are pre-generated, i.e. identical on all VMs, and the image is not hardened for production.
    <br/>Have fun!

  <section name="SVN over HTTPS">
    <p>
    The official "secure" delivery of EJBCA source code is in the <a href="repository.html">repository</a> using svn over https. The certificate is issued to cesecore.eu, which was the consortium behind the Common Criteria certification of EJBCA.
    <br/>
    In the SVN repository you can also find the hashes of release zip files in the history of the file doc/xdocs/site/index.xml.

    <p>If you are an Enterprise customer, you may also get an official release from <a href="https://www.primekey.com">PrimeKey</a>.
