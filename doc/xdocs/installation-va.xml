<section name="Standalone VA installation">
  <subsection name="Building and configuring EJBCA">
  <p>
EJBCA should be configured as for any other installation but you must also set all preferences
of the VA database in conf/va-publisher.properties. 
The VA database is the master database of all standalone VA installations. It is there that EJBCA will 
publish certificates when they are issued or revoked. 
</p><p>
After this configuration EJBCA is built and deployed as usual with the command 'ant deploy', as described in the EJBCA installation guide.
</p><p>
The deploy command sets up a datasource <b>java:/OcspDS</b> in JBoss, if you use another application server 
you must set up this datasource manually. It should be a datasource that is not involved in transactions
(a <i>no-tx-datasource</i> in JBoss), and it should have autocommit (should be default in JBoss).
</p><p>
When EJBCA has been started you have to add a new publisher. As a superadministrator you add this publisher
on the "Edit Publishers" page in the Admin GUI. Use publisher type "Validation Authority Publisher". 
</p>
<p>
Validation Authority Settings :
</p>
<ul>
<li>'Data Source' - is the database of the standalone VA where this publisher will publish certificates. Use java:/OcspDS if ocsp-datasource.jndi-name=OcspDS.</li>
<li>'Store certificate on responder' - stores the complete certificate on the responder. If this is unchecked only the information needed to answer OCSP requests are stored, but not the certificate itself.
There are good reasons not to publish the whole certificate. It is large, thus making it a bit of heavy insert and it may contain sensitive information. 
On the other hand some OCSP Extension plug-ins may not work without the certificate. A regular OCSP responder works fine without the certificate. Publisher for CA certificates (used on a 'Edit Certificate Authorities' page) must have this enabled.
</li>
<li>'Store CRL at the Validation Authority' should be set if the CRL store service of the VA should be used for a CA (only has a meaning for publishers used on a 'Edit Certificate Authorities' page).</li>
</ul>
<p>
All certificate profiles for certificates that should be available to the OCSP responder should
have a reference to this publisher. To configure this you must be a superadministrator.
</p><p>
All CAs that should have their certificates and CRLs published to the VA  should
have a reference to this publisher. To configure this you must be a superadministrator.
</p><p>
When all settings above have been done, every issued or revoked certificate with a certificate
profile that uses the ValidationAuthorityPublisher should be published in the responder
database as well as in the EJBCA database.
If the publishing is not working it is important to notice this and synchronize the databases again, 
see <a href="#Error%20handling">Error handling</a> below.
  </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection name="Building and configuring the VA">
  <p>
The VA is configured using the same configuration files as EJBCA. 
Only the preferences ocsp.*, crlstore.*, certstore.*, httpsserver.* and database.* are relevant to the responder but you may keep conf/*.properties
from the EJBCA setup since definitions of other properties does no harm.<br/>
</p>
<note> 
Note that the standalone VA uses the configuration options database.* and not the ocsp-database.* options to access the VA database.
</note>
<p>
Please read description of the configuration properties in conf/ocsp.properties.sample, conf/database.properties.sample, conf/crlstore.properties.sample, conf/certstore.properties.sample and perhaps 
conf/web.properties.sample (if SSL or different ports should be configured).
</p><p>
For the certificate and CRL store service the sample file should be enough to understand how to set it up. For the OCSP responder service there is separate <a href="installation-ocsp.html">setup instructions</a> for the Standalone OCSP installation.

</p><p>
The validation authority is built and deployed with:
</p><source>
ant va-deploy
</source>
<p>
on the VA server.
</p>

<subsubsection name="Responder database">
<p>
The standalone VA database (that OcspDS in EJBCA and EjbcaDS in standalone VA points to) only have to contain the CertificateData and CRLData table. These tables are 
created automatically by JBoss when it starts on the standalone VA.
</p><p>
The database connection settings on the standalone VA is configured and deployed in JBoss in the file 
JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/ejbca-ds.xml.
</p>

<section name="Error handling">
<p>
If there is an error publishing to the VA database, the VA/OCSP Responder will be out of sync with the CA.
It is very important to re-synchronize the databases in that case.
</p>
<p>
In case of failure to publish to the VA database the following error message will appear in the server log on the EJBCA
server:
</p>
<source>
Validation Authority ERROR, publishing is not working
</source>
<p>
This will be followed by more details of the error.
</p><p>
The log must be monitored to discover such a fault and if such a fault is discovered an alarm should notify 
the operator that he has to fix whatever is wrong and then synchronise the VA database with the EJBCA 
database (see 'Synchronise the database of the responder').
  </p>
  
  <subsection name="Synchronise the database of the responder">
  <p>
At the beginning and after failure in publishing to the VA responder, the master database of the
publishers must be synchronised with the CertificateData and CRLData table of the database of EJBCA.
If you only use OCSP and not CRL store, only the CertificateData table needs to be synchronised.
</p><p>
If there is a single certificate out of sync you can re-sync it by doing a 'Republish' from the admin-GUI.
</p><p>
The following procedure may be used to synchronise the database of EJBCA with the database of the
responder:
</p><p>
<b>1.</b> Prevent any further issuing of new certificates and revocation of old certificates until the
synchronisation is finished. This might be done by simply blocking the port to the adminweb.
<br/>
<b>2.</b> On the host of ejbca the following commands can be used to make the synchronisation:
Run on the OCSP responder machine (as root user in mysql):
</p>
<source>
mysqladmin drop ocsp_db;
mysqladmin create ocsp_db;
</source><p>
This drops and re-creates the ocsp database to clean it. Replace ocsp_db with the database name of your database.
<br/>
Run on the CA server:
</p>
<source>
mysqldump -u ejbca -p --compress ejbca_db CertificateData > CertificateData.dat
mysqldump -u ejbca -p --compress ejbca_db CRLData > CRLData.dat
cat CertificateData.dat | mysql -h ocspresponder ocsp_db
cat CRLData.dat | mysql -h ocspresponder ocsp_db
</source>
<p>
Replace your the username ejbca with your username.
ocspresponder is the external VA/OCSP responder host.
</p>
<note>
Note, that this can usually not be done from a windows machine, to a Linux machine, because windows is not case sensitive.
</note>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Check that the publishing is working before allowing issuing and revoking.
  </p>

<section name="Security considerations">
<subsection name="Database privileges">
<p>
Since the VA itself only reads from the database you should consider using a read-only database user for the VA.
The only write access needed to the database is the VA Publisher configured on the CA.
