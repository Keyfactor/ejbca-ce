  The library is freely usable under the LGPL 2.1 (or later) license for all parties interesting

<p>
EJBCA is an enterprise class PKI, meaning that you can use EJBCA to build a complete PKI infrastructure for your organization.
If you only want to issue a few single certificates for testing, there are probably options that will get you started quicker, 
but if you want a serious PKI we recommend EJBCA.
