    	and an external RA server that receives certificate requests. The request are periodically 
    	pulled by the CA and responses returned to the <a href="externalra.html">External RA</a>.

    <p>
        The following diagram shows the internal relations between the Stateless Session Beans as they are injected.
        An updated version of this diagram can be generated by running "ant gen-depgraph" on a machine where the
        "dot" application is available.
