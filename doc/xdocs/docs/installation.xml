<section name="EJBCA Installation">
<p>
EJBCA is a fully functional Certificate Authority built in Java.
Based on JEE6 technology it constitutes a robust, high
performance and component based CA. Both flexible and platform independent,
EJBCA can be used standalone or integrated in any JEE6 application.
</p><p>
The EJBCA Homepage can be found at <a href="http://www.ejbca.org/">http://www.ejbca.org</a>.
Information about contacting the EJBCA team, contributing to
EJBCA, etc can be found through the Homepage.
</p><p>
More documentation can also be found on the homepage and on the wiki site <a href="http://wiki.ejbca.org/">http://wiki.ejbca.org/</a>.
</p><p>
EJBCA is completely written in Java and should as such run on any
platform where a JEE server runs. Development and testing is
performed on Linux and Windows platforms.
</p></section>

<section name="Definitions and conventions">
<p>
In this document we use X_HOME to indicate the file system directory location of application X.
For example EJBCA_HOME is the home directory of the unzipped EJBCA distribution.
APPSRV_HOME is used interchangeably with for example JBOSS_HOME and is the home directory of the
application server.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Security">
<p>
Security is discussed below in the chapter about configuration in the User Guide
and in <a href="security.html">Security</a>.
</p><p>
Please take a minute to thoroughly consider the security
implications and make sure you know what you are doing when you are setting
up a CA.
</p><p>
Whether running running on Linux or Windows, you should consider using multiple levels of firewalls.
The first level of firewall could be a host based firewall such as IPTables in Linux or a similar approach on windows.
See the Security document for information about ports that are used.
</p>
<p>
Don't forget to configure your application server for security! See
<a href="security.html">security</a>.
Security is CRITICAL for a CA.

<section name="Upgrade">
<p>
See EJBCA_HOME/doc/RELEASE_NOTES and UPGRADE for information about upgrading from an 
earlier version of EJBCA.
</p></section>

<section name="Ubuntu quick start">
<note>
The current installation procedures for JBoss 7 / EAP 6 uses the JBoss CLI to configure the application server.
The JBoss CLI turns out not to be well suited for automated deploys however, so functions can break. 
For example if the machine has too few cores CLI connections will mysteriously terminate and report errors.
<br/>
Contributions to improve the automated installation on JBoss 7 / EAP 6 are welcome.
</note>
<p>This section provides a fast way to get installed and running for a test using Ubuntu Linux. 
To get more information a about configuration options etc (there are plenty), you should follow the regular <strong>Installation guide</strong> below.
</p><p>
This quick start guide assumes EJBCA 6.3, JBoss 7.1.1.Final and Java 7, but other version should also be possible to use by just replacing the versions.
We also assume installation is made in a user account with username "user". In your environment simply replace user with the username you are using.
<br/><b>Note</b> that the quick install will create a H2 database as ~/ejbcadb. If you run this multiple times, delete this file in order to remove the old database.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Ubuntu 14.04 server x64, default config, only OpenSSH server selected (or other Ubuntu of your choice, for example Ubuntu Desktop).
<ul>
<li>Add user with username 'user' during install. The path /home/user means the user's home directory below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open a new terminal "ejbca".</li>
<li>Install needed software from Ubuntu repositories.
<ul>
<li>sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk ant ant-optional unzip ntp</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install software not in Ubuntu repositories, JBoss 7.1.1.Final and EJBCA 6.3.<br/>
<ul>
<li>wget http://download.jboss.org/jbossas/7.1/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final.zip</li>
<li>wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ejbca/ejbca6/ejbca_6_3_1_1/ejbca_ce_6_3_1_1.zip</li>
<li>unzip jboss-as-7.1.1.Final.zip</li>
<li>unzip ejbca_6_3_1_1.zip</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure EJBCA so it can find the application server (JBoss).
<ul>
<li>echo "appserver.home=/home/user/jboss-as-7.1.1.Final" >> ejbca_6_3_1_1/conf/ejbca.properties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open new terminal "jboss" and start JBoss.<br/>
<ul>
<li>jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/bin/standalone.sh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build and deploy EJBCA to JBoss.
<ul>
<li>cd ejbca_6_3_1_1</li>
<li>ant deploy (just press enter if questions show up)</li>
<li>(now wait a little for JBoss to reload)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run install (in terminal "ejbca") to create initial Management CA and TLS keystores.<br/>
<ul>
<li>ant install (choose all default values)</li>
</ul>
<b>Note:</b> If ant install fails with errors this is typically due to deployment or start of JBoss that did not complete successfully. You will need to look in the server logs to find out
why it will not start correctly in your environment, See the <a href="adminguide.html#Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> section for more information.
</li>
<li>Go back to terminal "jboss" and restart JBoss.<br/>
<ul>
<li>ctrl-c</li>
<li>jboss-as-7.1.1.Final/bin/standalone.sh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copy /home/user/ejbca_6_3_1_1/p12/superadmin.p12 to admin desktop machine and import in web browser.</li>
<li>Open URL https://server:8443/ejbca, where 'server' is the servers name/ip.</li>
<li>Configure JBoss for logging, see <a href="#JBoss%207%20and%20EAP%206%20logging">JBoss 7 and EAP 6 logging</a> for instructions.</li>

<section name="RedHat Enterprise Linux quick start">
<p>This section provides a fast way to get installed and running for a test using RedHat Enterprise Linux. 
To get more information a about configuration options etc (there are plenty), you should follow the regular <strong>Installation guide</strong> below.
</p>
<p>
This quick start guide makes the same assumptions and uses the same procedures as the Ubuntu quick start guide.
RHEL by default only installs with a 'root' account. Therefore we start by creating a user account with username "user". In your environment simply replace user with the username you are using.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Install RHEL 6.4 x86_64, default config, 'Basic Server'.</li>
<ul>
<li>Don't forget to 'Configure Network' at the screen where you set the server hostname.</li>
<li>Make sure the hostname you set is present in /etc/hosts, or in DNS (or use the default localhost). If not JBoss will not start.</li>
<li>Log in as root.</li>
<li>Test that hostname is reachable.</li>
<ul>
<li>ping hostname (where hostname is the name you set during installation)</li>
</ul>
<li>Add user with username 'user'. The path /home/user means the user's home directory below.</li>
<ul>
<li>adduser user</li>
<li>passwd user</li>
</ul>
<li>Enable EJBCA ports in the firewall.</li>
<ul>
<li>system-config-firewall-tui</li>
<li>Add port 8080, protocol tcp</li>
<li>Add port 8442, protocol tcp</li>
<li>Add port 8443, protocol tcp</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Install needed software from RedHat repositories, still logged in as root (assumes RHEL 6.4 DVD in cdrom).</li>
<ul>
<li>vi /etc/yum.repos.d/install_dvd.repo</li>
</ul>
<pre>
[INSTALL_DVD] 
name=Installation DVD 
baseurl=file:///media/Server 
enabled=1 
gpgcheck=0 
</pre>
<ul>
<li>mount /dev/cdrom /media/</li>
<li>yum install ant ant-nodeps</li>
<li>umount /media/</li>
</ul>
This will install OpenJDK and apache ant.
<br/>Unfortunately the ant in RHEL 6 is too old (v1.7.1) so you need download a fresh version of ant. 
<br/>RHEL 7 contains a fresh version of ant, so the following is not needed for RHEL 7.
<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi">Download apache ant</a> and set it up to be first in the path. run 'ant -version' to verify that you have a recent ant version.</li>
<li>Log out from root account and log in as 'user' in a new terminal 'ejbca'.</li>
<li>After this follow the same steps, 4-11 as in the 'Ubuntu quick start' above.</li>
</ol>


<p>Done!</p>
<p>After installation <strong>do not</strong> forget to <strong>secure</strong> your installation as described in <a href="security.html#Securing JBoss">securing JBoss</a>.</p>
</section>

<section name="Installation guide">
<p>
If you want to get started really quick, and is using Ubuntu Linux, you can follow the <a href="#Ubuntu%20quick%20start">Ubuntu or RedHat quick start</a> guide above.
This guide describes how to install on the most well supported application server JBoss AS. EJBCA might however also run on Glassfish and Weblogic, but your
mileage may vary (see further below for details). 
</p>
<subsection name="Prerequisites">
<note>
EJBCA makes use of strong crypto and keystore passwords longer than 7 characters.
For this to work you must install the 'Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files' for JDK.
The policy files can be found at the same place as the JDK download at
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Oracle</a>. The text
"Using exportable cryptography" is shown on the first page in the Admin GUI if you fail to
install this package. Further information on this can be found in the Oracle documentation on
the JCE.
</note>
<p>
Needed to build and run are:</p>
<ul>
<li>JDK 7 OpenJDK or Oracle JDK, if available OpenJDK is recommended.</li>
<li>Only if using OracleJDK - <i>Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files</i> for your JDK.</li>
<li>JBoss Application Server 7.1.x or later or JBoss EAP 6 or later (<a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads">download</a>, note that the absolute latest may not always be tested). 
Or <a href="#WildFly%208">WildFly</a> 8 or later.</li>
<li>Apache Ant 1.8 or later to build (<a href="http://ant.apache.org/">download</a>). Note that javascript support may be needed in ant for some components.</li>
</ul>
 <p>
 Windows/Unix: 
 When we describe command line commands below we use
 unix notation, e.g. 'ejbca.sh' for the executable command files.
 The same command files are available for windows as cmd-files,
 e.g. 'ejbca.cmd.'
</p>
<p>If you are unsure what version of EJBCA you are running, type 'ant ejbcaversion' in the EJBCA_HOME directory.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Configure">

<subsubsection name="Configuration files">
<p>The configuration of EJBCA that can not be configured in the Admin GUI is located in properties files in the <i>conf</i> directory.
All properties are documented in sample files and to configure an option you copy the sample file, for example copy <i>conf/ejbca.properties.sample</i> to <i>conf/ejbca.properties</i>
and configure <i>conf/ejbca.properties</i>. You should at least familiarize your self with the options in <i>conf/install.properties</i>, <i>conf/ejbca.properties</i> and <i>conf/cesecore.properties</i>.
Most options, except those in install.properties can be changed after installation.
</p> 
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="EJBCA configuration">
<p>
1) Copy conf/install.properties.sample to conf/install.properties, conf/ejbca.properties.sample to conf/ejbca.properties and conf/cesecore.properties.sample to conf/cesecore.properties 
Customize if needed. The default values works fine for a test installation. 
</p>
<p>
You must configure 'appserver.home' in ejbca.properties to point to your application server directory. You find examples of how
to do this in ejbca.properties.sample.<br/> This makes libraries from the application server available to EJBCA during the build.
</p>
<p>
If you are only testing EJBCA at this stage and is not setting up a production environment, you can skip the rest of this step.
There are default configuration options, that should work in a test environment, for everything.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Customize the CA properties in conf/ejbca.properties if you need to do so.
For production use you need to do this, don't forget to edit
passwords to be secure and secret. Keep conf/ejbca.properties as secret as possible.
DO NOT forget the passwords, if you need to re-install the software sometime.</li>
<li>To use a hard ca token from start change ca.tokentype, ca.tokenpassword and ca.tokenproperties in install.properties. You also need to add the appropriate values to the ca.tokenproperties file for the HSM. Read the HSM documentation for the right values.</li>
<li>
To put the initial superadmin certificate on a smartcard, set superadmin.batch=false in
web.properties. Enroll from public web after the installation is complete, as you would
with any other smartcard user. Username is &quot;superadmin&quot; and password is superadmin.password
from web.properties.
</li>
<li>If you are deploying on JBoss EAP you probably want to look at the property 'jboss.config' as well, since 'production' may be the default server to start on JBoss EAP (depends on your configuration).</li>
</ul>
Do the same with other configuration files that you might want to customize. The default values often works fine and is a safe bet if you are unsure.
Most options are well documented in the sample files.
<ul>
<li>Customize the database in conf/database.properties if needed. 
But easiest thing is to keep the default as it is,
it will use the JBoss embedded HSQLDB and everything will be easier for you.
For production use you should use a real database instead of the embedded one.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="Configure application server">
<p>Due to differences, and bugs, in different application servers you have to configure your application server with some settings, and EJBCA with server specific settings.
<br/>See the <a href="#Application servers">application servers</a> section.</p>
<note name="JBoss 7 logging">
On JBoss 7 or EAP 6 you need to enable logging in order to see anything in the log files.
See <a href="#JBoss%207%20and%20EAP%206%20logging">JBoss 7 and EAP 6 logging</a> for instructions.
</note>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="Considerations">
<p>
When everything is prepared, there are a few things to
configure before starting your applications and running everything in a production environment.
</p><p>
In a production environment you should use something like the following structure:
<ol>
<li>Go through the install process creating an AdminCA. Use a simple DN. 
This CA should only used to issue the administrator certificates. Not published in LDAP. 
If you want to use an HSM for this CA, see the documentation in the configuration file conf/ejbca.properties.sample.</li>
<li>Once installed, create all your REAL CAs using the admin-GUI. Now you can use the certificate 
profiles etc that you like. These certificates can be published in LDAP.
See doc/howto/HOWTO-multiplecas.txt for example of a detailed configuration guide.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
In a production environment you should use something else than the default Hypersonic database that comes 
with JBoss for the reasons:
<ol>
<li>Hypersonic database is in-memory, which means that over time it will consume more memory. If a large
number of certificates is issued, it will become an issue after a while.</li>
<li>Hypersonic does not support full SQL, in particular ALTER statements. When a new version of EJBCA is 
released we can not create scripts that updates the database if some tables changed. This will make 
upgrades much much harder.</li>
</ol>
</p><p>
For information about installing JDBC drivers for other databases, see the document <i>'doc/howto/HOWTO-database.txt'</i>
in the distribution.
</p>
</subsubsection>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Install">
<p>
Note that the installation must be done with a user with privileges to write to APPSRV_HOME and sub directories.
Running the deploy and install commands as described will also configure the application server with data sources and web configuration automatically. 
If deploying on <a href="#WildFly%208">WildFly</a>, you should instead follow that guide to manually configure data sources and web. 
</p><p>
1) Set the property 'appserver.home' in conf/ejbca.properties to where your JBoss is installed,
examples:
</p> 
<source>
appserver.home=/opt/jboss-7.1.1.Final
</source>
<p>Also make sure the right java tools (javac/keytool) are available in your system PATH, ie. /usr/local/jdk1.7.0_25/bin.
</p>
<p>
2) Open a console (terminal) and start JBoss.
You can start JBoss with the normal command 'standalone.sh' (JBoss 7/EAP 6/WildFly) from APPSRV_HOME/bin. You should see JBoss
picking up everything and deploying the ear without errors.
</p><p>
3) Open a console and type:
</p>
<source>
ant deploy
</source>
<p>it will compile and build EJBCA and deploy it to JBoss, as well as automagically create data sources and mail service. You will be prompted to enter the value for database.password if it has
not already been defined in database.properties. 
</p><p>
4) Type:
</p>
<source>
ant install
</source>
<p>The command will generate all certificates, keys, etc needed to run with an initial CA, and configure TLS in the servlet container to use the generated keystore and truststore files (which are also copied in the process).
You will find admin keys in ${ejbca.home}/p12. (do not delete those files!)
<br/>The command 'ant install' is only run once, when the CA is first installed. It creates lots of things in the database, 
and can not be run again (it will give an error if you try).
<ul>
<li>tomcat.jks is for the Servlet container (don't bother with it)</li>
<li>truststore.jks is for the Servlet container (don't bother with it)</li>
<li>superadmin.p12 should be imported in your browser, that's your administration certificate.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<note>
Instead of creating an initial Admin CA and issuing administrator certificates from that, you can install using administrator certificates from an already existing external CA.
See <a href="userguide.html#Administrators%20issued%20by%20external%20CAs">Administrators issued by external CAs</a> for more information. This would replace step 4-8, but instead require other steps.
</note>
<p>
5) Restart JBoss (Ctrl+C if you run JBoss in the foreground in a terminal)
</p><p>
6) Import the certificate from EJBCA_HOME/p12/superadmin.p12 in your web browser. 
This is the super administrators certificate used to access the admin GUI. 
Other administrators with specific privileges can be created later on.
The default password for superadmin.p12 is ejbca, and is configured in web.properties.
</p><p>
7) Go to https://localhost:8443/ejbca/ to access the Admin GUI, or http://localhost:8080/ejbca for the public web pages.
</p><p>
If you create other CAs that you want to add as acceptable CAs in the SSL server configuration, 
or if you renew the CA certificate, you can install any CA certificate in the SSL server configuration afterwards 
with the following command:
</p>
<source>
ant -Dca.name="My CA Name" javatruststore
</source>
<p>
What this does in the background is that it adds the CA certificate to p12/truststore.jks and copies this file
to JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/keystore, where the SSL keystores are located.
</p>
<p>
You must stop and start JBoss after doing this.
</p>
</subsection>

</section>

<section name="Upgrade and reconfigure">
<p>
When upgrading EJBCA, read doc/UPGRADE for instructions related to different versions, and upgrading between them.
Upgrading withing patch verson (i.e. 6.0.3->6.04) are usually plug-in upgrades (you have to transfer your configuration though).</p>
<p>When you upgrade, or simply change a configuration setting in properties files, you do not need to fully re-install EJBCA, or re-configure the application server.
You simply want to deploy a new EJBCA application (ejbca.ear) to the application server. This is done with a simple command:
</p>
<source>
ant clean deployear
</source>
<p>
No need to run a full 'ant deploy'. This command cleans previous build and builds a new ejbca.ear file that is deployed (to JBoss). No re-configuration of the application server (datasource, TLS etc) is done.
</p>
<p>
For easy upgrades, keeping personal configuration between versions, you should consider using the <a href="adminguide.html#Customizing%20EJBCA">ejbca-custom feature</a>. 
</p>
</section>

<section name="Application servers">
<p>
EJBCA should run on any on any JEE5 compliant application server in theory. In reality it doesn't, because dofferent application servers have different tweaks for the standard.
It is not enough to pass JEE validation in order to run onn all application servers.
<ol>
<li>JBoss 7.1.1.Final / JBoss EAP 6: Works well. Community and professional support available.</li>
<li>JBoss 5.1.0.GA / JBoss EAP 5.1: JEE5, only supported in older version of EJBCA.</li>
<li>Glassfish 3.1.1: Not supported yet.</li>
<li>Glassfish 2.1.1: Works with older versions of EJBCA (before v6).</li>
<li>WebLogic: Does not work. Used to work with earlier versions of EJBCA.</li>
<li>WebSphere: Does not work. Has worked with one version of EJBCA in the past.</li>
<li>Geronimo: Not supported yet.</li>
<li>JoNaS: Not supported yet.</li>
<li>TomEE+: Not tested yet.</li>
<li>Payara: Not tested yet.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<subsection name="JBoss">
<note>JBoss 7 / EAP 6 are the official well tested platforms for EJBCA 6.x. Most of the development is done against JBoss.</note>

<subsubsection name="JBoss 7/EAP 6 General Notes">
<p>
Version JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final, EAP 6.1 and EAP 6.2 (and possibly later ones) has been tested with EJBCA, and it should work. There's a couple of caveats and notes you should be aware of:
<ul>
<li>Start and connect with the JBoss 7/EAP6 cli like this:
<pre>
./jboss-cli.sh
connect
</pre>
</li>
<li>If you're having problem with HornetQ start-up, try switching to Java NIO with the following commands in JBoss CLI administration tool:
<pre>
/subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=default:write-attribute(name=journal-type,value=NIO)
:reload
</pre>
</li>
<li>You don't need to start/stop JBoss 7, deployment is done with a live system (in fact you should have the JBoss 7 running at all times).</li>
</ul>
</p>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss 7/EAP 6 JDBC Drivers and Data Sources">
<p>
In JBoss 7/EAP6 it is not enough to just drop the JAR archive with a database JDBC driver into the deployments directory. Instead you will have to perform the following steps (for MySQL):
<ol>
<li>Create the necessary directories (relative to JBoss 7 base directory):
<br/>
On JBoss 7.1.1 or EAP 6.0:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/com/mysql/main/
</pre>
On JBoss 7.2 or EAP 6.1/6.2:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/system/layers/base/com/mysql/main/
</pre>
Or for MariaDB, mariadb-java-client-1.1.5.jar:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/org/mariadb/main/
</pre>
On JBoss 7.2 or EAP 6.1/6.2:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/system/layers/base/org/mariadb/main/
</pre>
</li>
<li>Place the mysql.jar or mariadb.jar file in the directory you just created.</li>
<li>Create, in the created directory, the JDBC module configuration file module.xml with the following contents (replace mysql.jar with the full name of your jar file for example mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar):
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;module xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:module:1.0&quot; name=&quot;com.mysql&quot;&gt;
  &lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;resource-root path=&quot;mysql.jar&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/resources&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.api&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.transaction.api&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
<!-- This is the original of above XML text.

  </resources>
  <dependencies>
    <module name="javax.api"/>
    <module name="javax.transaction.api"/>
  </dependencies>
</module>
-->
</pre>
Or for MariaDB, mariadb-java-client-1.2.2.jar:
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;module xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:module:1.0&quot; name=&quot;org.mariadb&quot;&gt;
  &lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;resource-root path=&quot;mariadb-java-client-1.2.2.jar&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/resources&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.api&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;javax.transaction.api&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;module name=&quot;org.slf4j&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/module&gt;
</pre>

</li>
<li>Register the driver by running the following two commands in the JBoss 7 CLI administration tool:
<pre>
/subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver:add(driver-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver,driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver,driver-module-name=com.mysql,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource)
:reload
</pre>
Or for MariaDB, mariadb-java-client-1.1.5.jar:
<pre>
/subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver:add(driver-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver,driver-module-name=org.mariadb,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=org.mariadb.jdbc.MySQLDataSource)
:reload
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>For PostgreSQL you would use the following values instead:
<pre>
mkdir -p modules/system/layers/base/org/postgresql/main/

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;module xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:module:1.0&quot; name=&quot;org.postgresql&quot;&gt;

</p>
<p>Datasources are normally created automatically by EJBCA during deployment and installation. Here we describe how to create a datasource in JBoss7/EAP6 for reference.
The examples are for installing a MariaDB datasource using the jboss-cli with the driver installed as described above. </p>
<p>A normal datasource:</p>
<source>
data-source add --name=ejbcads --driver-name="org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver" --connection-url="jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/ejbca" --jndi-name="java:/EjbcaDS" --use-ccm=true --driver-class="org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver" --user-name="ejbca" --password="ejbca" --validate-on-match=true --background-validation=false --prepared-statements-cache-size=50 --share-prepared-statements=true --min-pool-size=5 --max-pool-size=150 --pool-prefill=true --transaction-isolation=TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED --check-valid-connection-sql="select 1;"
</source>
<p>A no-tx / jta="false" datasource (OCSP publisher and Unid):</p>
<source>
data-source add --name=unidds --jta=false --driver-name="org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver" --connection-url="jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/unid" --jndi-name="java:/UnidDS" --use-ccm=true --driver-class="org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver" --user-name="uniduser" --password="unidpass" --validate-on-match=true --background-validation=false --prepared-statements-cache-size=50 --share-prepared-statements=true --min-pool-size=5 --max-pool-size=150 --pool-prefill=true --transaction-isolation=TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED --check-valid-connection-sql="select 1;"
</source>
<p>(note that 'select 1' must be different for DB2 and Oracle)</p>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss 7 and EAP 6 logging">
<p>
Logging can be configured using the CLI:
</p>
<source>
 /system-property=org.jboss.as.logging.per-deployment:add(value=false)
 /subsystem=logging/logger=org.ejbca:add
 /subsystem=logging/logger=org.ejbca:write-attribute(name=level, value=DEBUG)
 /subsystem=logging/logger=org.cesecore:add
 /subsystem=logging/logger=org.cesecore:write-attribute(name=level, value=DEBUG)
</source>
<p>The per-deployment feature was added in EAP 6.0.0 and is not present in GA 7.1.</p>
<p>In JBoss EAP 6 you can also configure a completely custom Log4J configuration by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do _not_ set 'org.jboss.as.logging.per-deployment' to false above, by default it's value is true, but you can also set it manually to true.</li>
<li>Create a $EJBCA_HOME/conf/log4j-jbosseap6.xml, you can use log4j-jbosseap6.xml.sample as a template. Set paths to the desired log files.</li>
<li>Redeploy with 'ant clean deployear'.</li>
</ul>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss 7/EAP 6 PKCS11">
<p>
JBoss 7/EAP 6 isolates away most sun classes. That means you will not be able to send certificates through remote EJB calls, and will not be able to use the Sun PKCS#11 provider.
These classes can be made available by editing the file
<i>modules/sun/jdk/main/module.xml (JBoss 7.1/EAP6.0)</i> and adding the following packages to the list of system export paths:
</p>
<source>
&lt;path name="sun/security/x509"/&gt;
&lt;path name="sun/security/pkcs11"/&gt;
&lt;path name="sun/security/pkcs11/wrapper"/&gt;
</source>
<p>
This will allow an application to use these internal Sun/Oracle/OpenJDK classes.
</p>
<p>This is not needed in JBoss EAP 6.1/JBoss 7.2, because the two first packages are exported by default since <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP6-1748">JBPAPP6-1748</a>.
One package is however needed still. In JBoss EAP 6.1 the file is located in <i>modules/system/layers/base/sun/jdk/main/module.xml</i>.
</p>
<source>
&lt;path name="sun/security/pkcs11/wrapper"/&gt;
</source>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss 7/EAP 6 CMP TCP">
<p>Note that the TCP transport of the CMP protocol is deprecated in the standard draft. TCP transport may be removed in future EJBCA releases.</p>
<p>
JBoss 7/EAP 6 isolates away  most sun classes. This means that the CMP TCP library is not able to get system properties.
The needed classes can be made available by editing the file
<i>modules/sun/jdk/main/module.xml (JBoss 7.1/EAP6.0) or modules/system/layers/base/sun/jdk/main/module.xml (JBoss 7.2/EAP6.1))</i> and adding the following package to the list of system export paths:
</p>
<source>
&lt;path name="sun/security/action"/&gt;
</source>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss 7/EAP 6 URI encoding and WSDL location">
<p><i>This section is a reference section, the configurations here are done automatically in JBoss 7 by the 'ant deploy' command in EJBCA.</i></p>
<p>The following configuration is recommended to be able to use international characters during certificate and CRL download:</p>
<source>
 /system-property=org.apache.catalina.connector.URI_ENCODING:add(value=UTF-8)
 /system-property=org.apache.catalina.connector.USE_BODY_ENCODING_FOR_QUERY_STRING:add(value=true)
</source>
<p>
On JBoss 7.1.x (and EAP 6.0.x) the WSDL location gets incorrectly generated by default (JBoss bind address, plain http). This will cause the WS client to not work.
This can be corrected using the JBoss CLI (the change requires a reload of JBoss server):
</p>
<source>
/subsystem=webservices:write-attribute(name=wsdl-host, value=jbossws.undefined.host)
:reload
</source> 
<p>
to force the location to be generated with info from the WSDL request. 
If this is not done you will get SSL errors about missing client certificate, or "HTTP 302 Moved Temporarily" errors when running the WS client.  
</p>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss Mail TLS configuration">
<p>
There are at least two ways to use TLS for SMTP connection:
</p>
<ul>
<li>SMTP STARTTLS</li>
<li>TLS required</li>
</ul>
<p>The first method can be configured with the setting <i>mail.smtp.starttls.enable</i> in conf/mail.properties.
Since mail configuration is done differently in different versions of JBoss we only provide guidance for the second version. There are two options that might be needed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>mail.smtp.ssl.enable=true</li>
<li>mail.smtp.socketFactory.class=javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory</li>
</ul>
<p>For JBoss 7/EAP 6 they should be set using the JBoss command line admin tool.</p>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss Service Timer persistence">
<p>EJBCA uses EJB timers to run services regularly (if you have services configured). By default JBoss persists timers in an internal, in memory, database. 
If you run services very often this can under some circumstances fill up the memory causing the server to be non-operational due to out ofmemory errors.</p>
<p>EJBCA does not need persistent timers since they are initialized during startup. Therefore it is recommended to run JBoss with non-persistent timers, something that can be configured.
</p>
<p>
<u>JBoss 7/EAP6 configuration</u>:
</p><p>
JBoss 7 does not use the in memory database to persist timers, but instead stores them in <i>jboss/standalone/data/timer-service-data/ejbca.ejbca-ejb.ServiceSessionBean</i>.
This is supposed to ensure that it will not fill up the memory as it did in JBoss 5.
<br/>
If persisted timers needs to be removed in JBoss 7 the directory <i>jboss/standalone/data/timer-service-data</i> can simply be deleted.
</p>
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss7/EAP6 deployment timeout">
In the case the deployment fails to complete within 60 seconds it will fail. You can increase this timeout with:
<source>
/subsystem=deployment-scanner/scanner=default:write-attribute(name=deployment-timeout,value=300) 
</source>
Unless there is a clear reason why this takes longer than 60 seconds (for example an HSM waiting for human input, or a <i>very</i> slow server,
check that database indexes are applied and that your network and any used DNS server is fully operational. 
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection name="JBoss 7 and Oracle JDK BC issues">
<p>
In EJBCA 6.0.4 <a href="https://jira.primekey.se/browse/ECA-3371">ECA-3371</a> solved the issue of deploying with OracleJDK.
</p>

<subsection name="WildFly 8">
<p>EJBCA 6.x compiles, deploys and runs with WildFly 8 and WildFly 9 (release following 6.3.1.1).</p>
<p>For WildFly deploy and install does not automagically configure the Application server for you, instead we supply configuration instructions for the Application server for you to follow.</p>

<subsubsection name="Add database driver">
<p>Add MariaDB database driver by hot-deploying it into the Ddeployment directory. This will be picked up by WildFly and deployed so we can create a datasource straight away.
You can use a generic name, without version number, in order to get a generic 'driver-name' for the data source command.

    When adding a Derby Pool use values: Name=EjbcaPool, Type=javax.sql.DataSource, Vendor=JavaDB.<br/>
    Properties: user=APP, password=APP, DatabaseName=ejbca<br/>
    Save and use the Ping-button for the pool. If you get 'Parameter wrong for this method : off', go to Additional Properties and delete 'Ssl'.<br/>
    Command line alternative:

    </ul>
    Add CA certificate to cacerts file:
    <ul>
       <pre>
       cd $EJBCA_HOME
       keytool -exportcert -keystore p12/truststore.jks -file p12/managementca.der -storepass changeit -alias managementca
       </pre>
    </ul>
    Install the CA certificate in the application servers truststore.<br/>
    On Glassfish open source:
    <ul>
       <pre>
       keytool -delete -keystore  $APPSRV_HOME/domains/domain1/config/cacerts.jks -alias managementca -storepass changeit
           (will fail if this hasn't been done before)
       keytool -importcert -keystore $APPSRV_HOME/domains/domain1/config/cacerts.jks -file p12/managementca.der -alias managementca -storepass changeit
       </pre>
    </ul>
    On Glassfish Enterprise:
    <ul>
    <li>cd $APPSRV_HOME/domains/domain1/config</li>
    <li>/usr/sfw/bin/certutil -A -n managementca -t "p,p,p" -i p12/managementca.der -d .</li>
    <li>verify that managementca has been added to the store with '/usr/sfw/bin/certutil -L -d .'.</li>
    </ul><br/>
    <li>
    (Optional) Replace the SSL keystore and truststore with default passwords.<br/>
    In a production environment you probably want to change the keystore passwords, to do this you must edit both the http-listener and the IIOP-listeners.
    <pre>
    cd $EJBCA_HOME
    cp p12/tomcat.jks p12/keystore.jks
    keytool -list -keystore p12/keystore.jks -storepass serverpwd
        Read the alias for the "PrivateKeyEntry" e.g. 'localhost'.
    keytool -keypasswd -keystore p12/keystore.jks -alias localhost -storepass serverpwd -keypass serverpwd -new changeit
    keytool -storepasswd -keystore p12/keystore.jks -storepass serverpwd -new changeit
    keytool -changealias -keystore p12/keystore.jks -alias localhost -destalias s1as -keypass changeit -storepass changeit
    cp p12/keystore.jks $APPSRV_HOME/domains/domain1/config/keystore.jks
    </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Restart server
    <pre>
    asadmin stop-domain
    asadmin start-domain
    </pre>
    </li>
</li>
<li>Access protected EJBCA pages<br/>
    Import $EJBCA_HOME/p12/superadmin.p12 in your browser and go to url:<br/>
      https://127.0.0.1:8181/ejbca/<br/>
    You can now click "Administration" to get to the admin-GUI.</li><br/>
<li>(Optional) Change how often an EJBCA Service can run: Configuration -> EJB Container -> EJB Timer Service -> Minimum Delivery Interval: 1000. Restart application server.<br/>
This can also be changed using the "minimum-delivery-interval-in-millis" attribute in the domain.xml-file when the appserver isn't running.</li>
<li>(Optional) Apply workaround to enable redeployment without application server restart: See <a href="https://jira.primekey.se/browse/ECA-1887">ECA-1887</a>.</li>

<subsubsection name="Glassfish Ubuntu package">
<p>
The above instructions are tested on the official release from Glassfish's homepage. 
We had this report from a user of the glassfish package on ubuntu.
</p>
<p> 
I had to modify the following to make it work with the Ubuntu 9.04
glassfish package.
<pre>
1. Modify /usr/bin/asadmin
   #GF_DOMAIN_DIR=$HOME/glassfishv2
   GF_DOMAIN_DIR=/var/lib/glassfishv2/domains
2. Set APPSRV_HOME to /usr/share/glassfishv2
</pre>
The Ubuntu package has the domains and binaries separated.  When
following the install instructions, when you do anything with the
domain you have to point to /var/lib/glassfishv2/[directory] instead
of $APPSRV_HOME/[directory].

<p>In some cases, either if you have a slow machine or very large data sets, some common operations can take a long time to complete. The default transaction timout of

<subsection name="Ant target shortlist">
<p>
To deploy and install EJBCA the first time (from clean database):
<ul>
<li>ant deploy</li>
<li>ant install</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To upgrade EJBCA, i.e. just deploy a new ejbca.ear file:
<ul>
<li>ant deployear</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To (re)configure TLS, i.e. configure TLS ports and deploy TLS keystores:
<ul>
<li>ant web-configure</li>
<li>ant deploy-keystore</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To (re)configure database, i.e. deploy EjbcaDS datasource:
<ul>
<li>ant deploy-datasource</li>
</ul>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Files deployed">
<p>
Here we describe shortly which files/functions are copied/touched during various ant targets that are called. These targets only modifies files automatically on platforms where auto-configure is supported,
but it will give an indication as well for other platforms what configuration steps are needed.
</p>
<p>Below shows JBoss (configuration) files updated. For JBoss 7/EAP6 there is only one unified configuration file and all configuration is done using the JBoss 7 command line interface.

<note>
These additional howtos are for advanced users. If this is the first time installing EJBCA, or you run into trouble with these guides, please go back and try the regular quick install guide.
</note>
<p>
Branko Majic have a good detailed guide for setting up <a href="http://majic.rs/book/free-software-x509-cookbook/setting-up-ejbca-as-certification-authority">EJBCA with JBoss</a> in a rather thorough setup.
</p>
<p>
In the directory doc/howto in the distribution there are additional howtos for some specific platforms and configurations.
