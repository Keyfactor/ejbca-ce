EJBCA 6.2.0
-----------
This is a major release with new features, bug fixes and improvements. All in all, 76 issues have been fixed.

The biggest news in this release is a rework of the local CLI (command line interface), bringing the CLI up to the most 
modern standard with option handling and manual pages. 

* Noteworthy changes:
- Completely reworked command handling of local command line interface (CLI) (See note 2)
- It's now possible to import and export Certificate and End Entity Profiles from the GUI
- VA machines can be created using a CRL
- Certificate and End Entity Profiles can now be imported and exported form the Web GUI
- SCEP configuration has been implemented from the Web GUI

Note 1: 
If you are customizing the EJBCA public web to be embedded in a frame, note that EJBCA now uses the X-FRAME-OPTIONS HTTP header, 
preventing web GUIs from being framed in modern browsers. 

Note 2: 
Some CLI commands have changed names, though legacy support for the old names still remains. Some commands have had to undergo syntax changes, and they are as follows: 
 * General 									- Explicit password flag for CLI user password has been changed to '--clipassword' 
 											- All CLI commands' help pages can be summoned with the '--help' switch
 * CaImportCACommand 						- Command performs two different tasks depending on the number of arguments, which are mostly mutually exclusive and unswitched, hence impossible to identify. 
 * CaImportCertCommand 						- The optional values e-mail, cert profile and ee profile must be used with a switch. 
 * CaInitCommand 							- The catokenproperties is now optional (no need to substitute with null if unused) 
 * CaRenewCACommand 						- The <regenerate keys> argument has been turned into a flag (-R), and a switch was added for the Custom Not Before value. 
 * InternalKeyBindingCreateCommand 			- The "--property" switch is no longer needed. Instead optional properties are loaded dynamically, but must be entered with a "-" preceding the property name. 
 * InternalKeyBindingModifyCommand 			- Multiple "--addtrust" and "--removetrust" are no longer allowed, instead a separator "," may be used. Also, the --property switch is no longer used, 
 											  instead properties are loaded dynamically and used like with InternalKeyBindingCreateCommand 
 * AddEndEntityCommand 						- Password parameter now input with --password flag, leaving blank will prompt. subjectAltName and email have been made optional and equipped with flags. 
 											  certificateprofile, endentityprofile and hardtokenissuer have been given flags. hardtokenissuer options won't appear at all unless hard tokens been turned on. 
 * Services 								- The -listFields|-listProperties switched have been turned into commands instead 
 * ServiceCreateCommand/ServiceEditCommand 	- properties are sent in as a single command instead, at least until Services can be properly refactored and made more dynamic

See the notes, and known issues, for 6.1.0 below.

EJBCA 6.1.2
-----------
This is a maintenance release with only one bug fixes. In all 1 issue have been fixed.

* Noteworthy changes:
- Fixed an issue where browser enrollment link was generated with incorrect encoding

See the notes, and known issues, for 6.1.0 below.

EJBCA 6.1.1
-----------
This is a maintenance release with a few bug fixes. In all 4 issues have been fixed.
EJBCA 6.1.0 was never distributed publicly.

* Noteworthy changes:
- Fixed some regressions that prevented 6.1.0 from functioning optimally.

See the notes, and known issues, for 6.1.0 below.

EJBCA 6.1.0
-----------
This is a major release with new features, bug fixes and improvements. In all 32 issues have been fixed.
The biggest news in this release are support for EAC 2.10 access control templates, more OCSP improvements as 
well as improvements for Key Recovery. 

* Noteworthy changes:
- OCSP improvements and new features related to RFC 6960, minimizing size of OCSP responses (see note below).
- Implemented OCSP signing algorithm including client requested algorithms.
- CVC certificate profiles (ePassport PKI) now supports EAC 2.10 access control templates.
- Improvements to Key Recovery enabling encryption key rollover and providing more information about encryption keys.
- Windows build/install is now working.
- ManagementCA created during a default install now uses SHA256WithRSA.
- EJBCA now compiles (deployment/running not supported however) on WildFly 8 and Glasshish 4, also using Java 8.
- EJBCA can now use certificate serial number longer than 64 bits.
- Minor improvements and fixes to make life easier for everyone.

Note 1: OCSP responses no longer includes the Root CA Certificate, unless the Root CA is the OCSP signer, and it is configured to 
include the signer certificate. Having OCSP responses as small as possible is an important performance feature, and since the 
client must have the root certificate as trusted there is no need to include the root certificate in the chain. 

Note 2: In EJBCA 6.1.0 the Public Web interface logo filename was changed. If you have customized your own logo, you need to rename 
the logo filename from 'logotype.png' or 'ejbca_pki_by_primekey_logo.png' to 'banner_ejbca-public.png'.

EJBCA 6.0.0
-----------
EJBCA 6.0.0 is the latest major release of EJBCA, and both introduces and redefines a number of core concepts. Foremost amongst these are:

-  Main Changes:
	*	The concept of Crypto Tokens has been introduced in order to separate CAs from the keys tied to them. Crypto Tokens allow for 
		reuse of keystores between CAs or for other services like OCSP, and make configuration of keystores, both hard and soft, far simpler. 
		For additional information see Admin Guide and http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/08/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-1-crypto.html
	*	CMP is now fully configurable in the Admin GUI, and you can simultaneously use multiple different CMP configurations, called CMP aliases.
  		For additional information see Admin Guide and http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/09/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-2-cmp-aliases.html
	*	There is a new concept of Internal Key Bindings to bind a Crypto Token to a certificate for different usages, OCSP signing and TLS 
		authentication.
  		For additional information see User Guide and http://blog.ejbca.org/2013/10/whats-new-in-ejbca-6-part-3-internal.html
	* 	The merging of EJBCA and VA deployments. VA deployments are no longer anemic versions of EJBCA, instead all VA functionality has been
		merged into EJBCA proper. This for a single installation procedure, and for a machine to function as a CA and a VA simultaneously. 


-  Other Noteworthy Changes:
	*	Internal OCSP services are no longer configurable from the CA, but are instead automatically set up and always active. 
	*	OCSP code has been brought up to CESeCore standard 
	*	The installation work-flow and ant targets have changed to be more logical for deployment and installation.
	*	'Certificate Request History' is now disabled by default for new CAs.
	*	PKCS11 crypto tokens can now be managed by slot label (in addition to slot number and index) 
	*	JBoss 7.1 and EAP 6 are now supported
	*   Java 7 is now the default recommended Java version.
	
-  Minor Changes:
	* 	The term 'Admin Group' has been mostly purged and replaced with 'Role', as has the term 'User' been replaced by 'End Entity'
	*	Changes to certificate profiles:
		- The PKIX QCSyntax-v1 identifier from RFC3739 has been removed and will never be generated.
		- If "PKIX QCSyntax-v2" in the Certificate Profile is unchecked, no QCStatement with QCSyntax will be generated (new behavior).
  		- If "PKIX QCSyntax-v2" in the Certificate Profile is checked, a QCStatement with PKIX QCSyntax-v2 will be generated (same as before).
  	*	The default management CA has been renamed from AdminCA to ManagementCA.
	*	Many many minor features, improvements and bug fixes (over 300 issues are resolved for this release)  
  
Read the full Changelog for details.

For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE.

EJBCA 5.0.13
-----------
This is a maintenance release with only minor bug fixes, where one is a security fix. In all 4 issues have been fixed.

The security issue is rated as low, and can lead only to excessive CPU usage, if exposed to untrusted networks.

* Noteworthy changes:

Read the full Changelog for details.
For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE.
	  
EJBCA 5.0.12
-----------
This is a maintenance release with only security fixes.
Two cross site scripting vulnerabilities were discovered in EJBCA and fixed accordingly. 

The vulnerabilities are rated as low, with a CVSS score between 1 and 3 (depending on subjective assessments).

The complexity to exploit the vulnerabilities is considered high and requires knowledge of the internal CA network as well
as social engineering, or malicious internal super administrators.

The consequences of an exploit is considered low, as no administrator credentials can be stolen, and full audit logs of all 
actions are preserved.  

We recommend that you assess the need to upgrade based on your particular deployment of EJBCA. Most CA deployments are largely 
immune due to environmental isolation.
 
For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE.

EJBCA 5.0.11

EJBCA 5.0.2
-----------
This minor release primarily addressed issues that cropped up during manual testing for Common Criteria
certification. Quite some effort was also put into stabilizing the 5.0.x release.

* Noteworthy changes:
- Support has been added for incorporating external plugins in the EJBCA EAR file at build time. 
- Some XSS issues have been corrected. 
- Authorization checks have tightened up in accordance to Common Criteria demands. 
- Access rules for logging have finally been reconciled between CESeCore and EJBCA. The implication of this is
that the old EJBCA rules have been converted to the newer CESeCore rules, while those rules lacking application
in the new Secure Audit logging have been removed (all old rules matching /log_functionality/view_log/*_entries). 
Thus in the new logging system it is no longer possible to add rules to a role allowing that rule to only view a
certain type of log event depending on what entry that event was registered as. Old rules are upgraded during 
<ant post-upgrade>, which means that Supervisor roles won't work until this step is performed. Installations made in
5.0.0 or 5.0.1 need to be upgraded manually (see UPGRADE document), while installations upgraded from 4.0.x will have
their rules upgraded as part of the standard upgrade procedure. 
- Chinese characters are now supported in DN attributes for End Entity Profiles.
- Lots of small bug fixes.

For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE.

EJBCA 5.0.1
-----------
This minor release primarily fixed some CMP issues, one regression that was introduced in 5.0.0 and introduced

* Noteworthy changes:
- Support for Permanent Identifiers (RFC4043)
- Support for authorityInformationAccess in CRLs (RFC4325)
- Split xdocs in two separate sites, ejbca.org site and documentation site
- Documentation of EJBCA Djigzo integration

Read the full Changelog for details.
For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE.

EJBCA 5.0.0
-----------
This major release marks a new step as EJBCA is now built on the Common Criteria certified secure core: CESeCore. The 
negative implications of this for the end customer should be minimal, as database changes are few and far between, and 
there is a clear upgrade path from EJBCA 4.0.x

CESeCore primarily provides two new features that will be of interest to the end user:
- The old database audit log system has been removed and replaced by a new security audit function that is capable
of storing integrity protected audit records in the database. 
- Integrity protection has been introduced to essential tables. This means that rows in these tables can't be modified
through direct database interaction without invalidating the row.

Additionally, the following feature has been introduced.
- The Command Line Interface now uses authentication. Users are drawn from the standard End Entities list, and have the same respective
roles. A default CLI user is created as a part of startup/upgrade in order to allow allow the CLI to be used without authentication, 
and can be turned off from the Administration Interface. This user is defined in ejbca.properties

For administrators, the following changes are worth noting:
- When upgrading from 4.x to 5.x new approval requests created in a 5.x instance can not be read in a 4.x instance. 
So if you require uptime and roll-back capabilities, only allow to create new approval requests from an 4.x host.
- A "Super Administrator Role" is created during either bootstrap or upgrade to create a role for the default CLI user.
- 'Admin Groups' have been renamed 'Roles'. Relevant database tables remain unchanged.
- 'Admin Entities' are now referred to as 'Access User Aspects'.
- 'Users' are now ubiquitously referred to as 'End Entities'.
- Usage of access rules have in some cases changed, and some new access rules have been added (edit publishers). After an 
upgrade to 5.0, verify your roles and privileges.

The ISO8601 date format (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ssZZ) is used in the Admin GUI and EJBCA WS interface,
so clients no longer have to be aware of in what time zone the CA servers are located.
The old format (in US Locale) will still work for incoming requests in the WS, but any returned
UserDataVOWS containing custom start and end date will use the new format.

If you get a "java.lang.NoSuchMethodError" in the admin GUI it is because JBoss does not clean temporary files very good.
Delete the directories JBOSS_HOME/server/default/tmp and JBOSS_HOME/server/default/work and restart JBoss to get it working.

Read the full changelog for details.

For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE. 

EJBCA 4.0.0
-----------
EJBCA 4 uses Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) 5 instead of J2EE. This release is a major improvement
of the core, modularization, portability and packaging, but you will not notice many functional
differences.

The database schema is fully defined through the Java Persistence API and table create scripts are
provided for all the supported databases.

The Ingres database can now be used with EJBCA without patching the code.

Many bugs have been corrected. For example EJBCA Services will run more stable in a clustered
environment.

The interface ICustomPublisher has been modified, via removal of the number parameter from the
storeCRL method. Any custom classes implementing this interface need to be modified.

Java 1.6 and Ant 1.7.1 or higher is required from this version on.

Read the full changelog for details.

For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE and have a look in the installation instructions for
notes on how to configure your application server.

Known issues (see EJBCA issue tracker for a more updated version):
- XKMS Signature validation does not work. (ECA-2078)
- OCSP re-keying on JBoss 6.0.0.FINAL does not work. (ECA-2077)

EJBCA 3.11.1
-----------
This is a maintenance release - 16 issues have been resolved. Only fixes and layout improvements, no new features. 
This release fixes an upgrade issue from 3.6.x to 3.11.x and also a MySQL/MyISAM related issue in the 3.11.0 release.
A few uncaught regressions from 3.10.x and 3.11.0 were fixed, and as usual David Carella of Linagora added some 
Admin GUI layout improvements.

Changes:
- It is now possible to easily upgrade from EJBCA 3.6.x to 3.11.x
- Fixed a MySQL mapping that did not work when using the MyISAM storage engine and UTF-8 encoding.
- ETSI QC value limit can now have the value zero.
- Admin GUI improvements from David Carella of Linagora.
- Added a favicon to the EJBCA web interfaces. 
- Fixed an issue causing cached end entity profiles (not default) to be changed for some actions in the admin GUI.
- Fixed an issue where session information spilled over to other edits when using the "Back to certificate profiles" link.
- Fixed an issue where using the required flag on Cardnumber in a end entity profile gave error about missing unstructured address.
  This also resolved an issue where the DN field Unstructured Address did not work.

Read the full changelog for details.

For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE. 

NOTE: If you have been using the SEIS Cardnumber extension in End Entity Profiles (not default), this setting had an internal collision
with the UnstructuredAddress DN field, so they could not be used at the same time. There was a problem using the UnstructuredAddress lately.
The issue was resolved by changing the internal number for Cardnumber. This is not possible to upgrade automatically.
* If you used SEIS Cardnumber * you must manually edit your end entity profiles and re-check the 'use' checkbox after upgrade to 3.11.1.
This should affect a very small number of users.

EJBCA 3.11.0
-----------
This is a major release with several new features - 47 issues have been resolved. 
One major goal with this release is to prepare for a seamless migration to EJBCA 4.0. To make 
the migration path to EJBCA 4.0 a simple plug-in upgrade, EJBCA 3.11 introduces database changes
needed to make the schema fully compatible and consistent across all supported databases.

Upgrade to EJBCA 3.11 should be simple as usual, just follow the instructions in doc/UPGRADE.

Noteworthy changes:
- Possibility to configure CA not to use certificate and user store, meaning that CA can issue certificates without having to access database after service startup.
- External OCSP responder can now function as a validation authority serving OCSP, CRLs and CA certificates.
- Certificate store access via HTTP according to RFC4387 standard.
- Possibility in WebService Interface to specify extended information when editing users.
- Possibility to specify custom certificate serial number for end entities using CMP protocol. CMP RA secret can now also be specified per CA.
- Upgrade database schema to be consistent across databases.
- Add a few new columns to database tables, a preparation to be used in EJBCA 4.0.
- Improvements in the Glassfish support, now also usable with Oracle database. 
- Several other new features and extended key usages, GUI improvements and performance enhancements - many of which are contributed by Linagora.

*Important notes*
1. 
If you have a very large database (>1 million issued certificates) you can probably not run the database schema upgrade 
scripts automatically, but you want better control of the changes. You can then run the upgrade SQL statements manually.
You can find them under src/upgrade/310_311, with an individual sql file for your database.
  
2.
The external OCSP responder module have many added features in this release. This has caused some configuration file changes. See VA Installation documentation.
Specifically the CA Publisher datasource configuration has moved from ocsp.properties to va-publisher.properties, a much better location. 
Health check settings has moved from ocsp.properties to va.properties.

3.
the database schema has changed. If you run an external OCSP responder the database schema on that must also be updated for the VA/OCSP publisher to work.
The two new columns rowVersion and rowProtection does not have to be set to any specific value. 

4.
The error message when publishing fails has changed from "EXTERNAL OCSP ERROR" to "Validation Authority ERROR". If you have scripts monitoring this, they must be updated. 

EJBCA 3.10.6
-----------
This is a maintenance release with one new feature. 
This release is a very small maintenance release to mark the end of the 3.10 branch, anticipating 3.11.0 to be released withing a few days.
If you are running 3.10.5 with no issues, there is no real reason to upgrade to 3.10.6.

Changes:
- ExtendedInformation, such as issuance revocation reason, can now be added when editing users with the WebService API.

The release also fixes four minor or exotic bugs.

Read the full changelog for details.

Note: The WebService WSLD has changed for adding ExtendedInformation in the UserDataVOWS object. 
Old WS clients without this should still work and we have tested with older EJBCA clients. 
However if you depend on the WS-API you must test in your environment before bringing this new version in production.
 
For upgrade instructions, please see UPGRADE. 

EJBCA 3.10.5
-----------
This is a maintenance release with 37 issues resolved, both features and bug fixes.

EJBCA 3.10.3
-----------
This is a maintenance release with only 6 issues fixed. 
The release was primarily done to fix a regression for EAC CVC CAs using ECC keys.  
  
Noteworthy changes:
- EAC CVC Document Verifiers using ECC keys did not work properly. This was fixed and new test cases was added to the test suite.
- Removed requirement to use "Batch generation" when using CMP RA mode.
- Fixed issue that revocation in admin gui did not work with CAs using accented characters.
- Added code to mitigate potential cross site scripting in admin gui. Note that client certificate authentication was still needed so it was not publicly exploitable.

Read the full changelog for details.

In EJBCA 3.10.2 the Exception handling for NotFoundExceptions when a user does not exist was slightly overhauled. 
This effected some WS-API calls (findCerts, getLastCertChain and getHardTokenData). The behavior of the methods are unchanged, but if 
you have handling for such errors you should double check the error handling anyhow. Javadoc has been updated where it was previously not clear.

EJBCA 3.10.1
-----------
This is a maintenance release with a few new features, some improvements and several bug fixes. 33 issues in total have been resolved. 

Changes:
- New WS-API methods for renewing CAs. This enables the possibility for automated SPoCs in an EAC ePassport PKI.
- New CMP proxy module letting you have a separate server terminating CMP connections and then forwarding them to the CA.

CA administrators bye default has this new privilege. If you do not want them to have this privilege you can disable it in 
Advanced mode in the edit privileges section of the admin GUI. 
The new privileges can be used together with the new WS-API functions and CLI to renew specified CAs. 
To be authorized the administrator need both the new "Renew CA" privilege and and be authorized to the specific CAs.
The methods in CAAdminSessionBean that have changed privileges are renewCA, makeRequest and receiveResponse.

certificate. If this will result in any problem in your installation you may disable any of these checks on the "Edit CA" page. You can read
more about it in the user guide.

Noteworthy changes:
- Restructuring and refactoring to improve maintainability, prepare for the EJBCA 4 release and Common Criteria certification.

EJBCA V1.1
----------

Upgrading from version 1.0:

If upgrading from version 1.0 the database tables need to be
migrated if the
DN attributes L or ST have been used. This is because the
ordering of those
attributes have changed (for string matching the order must be
defined).

If L or ST have not been used in DNs, migration is NOT needed.

What need to be done are to:
1. Read column with DN to me migrated from table.
2. Run 'newDN=CertTools.stringToBCDNString(oldDN)'.
3. Update column with DN in table.

Columns that need updating are:
issuerDN in table CRLData
subjectDN, issuerDN in table CertificateData
subjectDN in table UserData.

If a tool is needed to perform the migration, please contact us.
