EJBCA V3.1.4
------------
This is a minor release with some new features and some bugfixes.
Read the changelog for details.

This is a plugin-upgrade from 3.1.3. Except for the following:
If you changed 'datasource.jndi-name' from the default value i ejbca.properties,
edit you ejbca.properties and add 'java:/' in front of your old value.

Otherwise simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation, 
copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

EJBCA V3.1.3
------------
This is a minor release with some new features and some bugfixes.
Read the changelog for details.

This is a plugin-upgrade from 3.1.2.
Simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation, 
copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

Note that to fix ECA-144, 148 and 75, new version of lib/bcmail*.jar and
lib/bcprov*.jar are used. Since they are binary files they are not
included in the patch from version 3.1.2 to 3.1.3. You can use the patch and
manually replace the jar-files from the full distribution.

The 3.1.3 release have support for RSASSA-PSS signatures to conform to the 
Swedish standard for MRTD certificates (Electronic Passports). 
The RSASSA-PSS parameters can be seen and edited in the file
src/java/se/anatom/ejbca/ca/caadmin/ExtendedX509Util.java.15 

IMPORTANT, compliation using jdk1.5 is required for this algorithm. 
Otherwise this algorithm option won't show up

Enhanced support for international characters in the adminweb gui (Add/Edit pages). 
Should work with most languages now.

It's now also possible to select a subset of a users SubjectDN and SubjectAltName 
fields used in a particular kind of certificate. This is defined in the certificate profiles

EJBCA V3.1.2
------------
This is a minor release with two new features and some bugfixes.
Read the changelog for details.

This is a plugin-upgrade from 3.1/3.1.1.
Simply keep ejbca.properties from the earlier release, and 'ant deploy' this
new one.

Note that to fix ECA-126, new version of lib/bcmail-jdk14.jar and
lib/bcprov-jdk14.jar are used. Since they are binary files they are not
included in the patch from version 3.1 to 3.1.2. You can use the patch and
manually replace the jar-files.


EJBCA V3.1.1
------------
This is a minor release with a few small bugfixes found in the 3.1 release.
Read the changelog for details.

This is a plugin-upgrade from 3.1.

EJBCA V3.1
----------
This is a major release including many new features, improvements, and bug fixes. 
Read the full changelog.
We are very proud of this release and recommend an upgrade.

This is mostly a plugin-upgrade from 3.0.7, no database changes needed. 

Since the changes are massive, no patch file is provided. 

To upgrade from 3.0.x follow doc/UPGRADE. 
Please read this carefully!

EJBCA V3.0.7
------------
This is a plugin-upgrade from 3.0.6 or 3.0.5. 
Apply patch, build and redeploy.

EJBCA V3.0.6
------------

This is a plugin-upgrade from 3.0.5. 
Apply patch, build and redeploy.

If you are using the hard token stuff on MySQL (which you probably aren't or you would have noticed 
this bug), you should drop the table HardTokenData and restart JBoss to recreate the table.

EJBCA V3.0.5
------------

This is a plugin-upgrade from 3.0.4. 
Apply patch, build and redeploy.

For users of MS SQL 2000 you should note the column name 'rule_' (earlier 'rule' which is 
a reserved word) in the table AccessRulesData.

EJBCA V3.0.4
------------

This is a plugin-upgrade from 3.0.3. 
Apply patch, build and redeploy.

EJBCA V3.0.3
------------

The database table 'hardtokenprofiledata' using the database HypersonicSQL changed. 
If you are using the hardtoken functionality on the HypersonicSQL database
(which you should not be doing in production), the table must be removed and
recreated. No migration script is provided since we don't anticipate anyone using
this combination in production.

EJBCA V3.0
----------
EJBCA 3.0 is a major new release taking the Open Source CA to new heights. 
The most important improvment is that it is now possible to run several
PKI infrastructures within one single instance of EJBCA. Among other major improvements are also 
complete support for OCSP, enanced Hard token interface and flexible 
LDAP configuration through the Web-GUI.

This is a plugin-upgrade from beta3.

This release is not backwards compatible with EJBCA 2.1 without database upgrade.
Upgrade instructions must be followed if upgrading from EJBCA 2.1, 
backup your database before trying any upgrades.

EJBCA V3.0Beta3
---------------
This is a plugin-upgrade from beta2.
There is an upgrade function from EJBCA2->EJBCA3 for the MySQL database, see doc/UPGRADE.

EJBCA V3.0Beta2
---------------
Thanks to a bug in Beta1 the database table 'HardTokenPropertyData' has changed. If you have been
using the HardToken features in Beta1, or plan to use them in the future, this table must be rebuilt.
'drop table hardtokenpropertydata' will delete and rebuild the table (data must be entered again).

Apart from this, it is a plug-in upgrade.

EJBCA V3.0beta1
---------------
EJBCA 3.0 is a major new release taking the Open Source CA to new heights. 
The most noteworthy change is that it is now possible to run a complete (or several)
PKI infrastructure within one single instance of EJBCA.

This release is not backwards compatible with EJBCA 2.1 without database upgrade.
Upgrade instructions must be followed if upgrading from EJBCA 2.1, 
backup your database before trying any upgrades.

The (default) LDAP schema has been changed to follow RFC 2256. If using LDAP, 
the schema should be checked. You can configure the schema 
(in ca/ca/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml) to be the same as before if needed.

EJBCA V2.1.2
------------
This is a plugin upgrade from V2.1.

The (default) LDAP schema has been changed to follow RFC 2256. If using LDAP, 
the schema should be checked. You can configure the schema

from $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/lib.

EJBCA V2.0
----------
Name of initial temporary super administrator changed from "CN=
Walter" to "CN=
SuperAdmin". A new must be created.

All defined administrator privileges must be redefined.

Certificate profiles should be redefined.

Drop tables GlobalConfigurationData, AdminGroupData,
AdminEntityData,
AccessRulesData and EndEntityProfileData to flush configuration
and
administrator privileges (actually deleting the content would be
enough but you
might as well drop the tables).

Delete bcmail-jdk13-116.jar, jce-jdk13-116.jar, ldap.jar and
regexp1_0_0.jar from $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/lib.

EJBCA V2.0B1
----------
We have moved to EJB 2.0. JBoss 3 is now required.
A complete reinstall from EJBCA 1.x is required, old jars, wars
and ears must be

migrated.
A Web GUI for administration is available through https, see
doc/README for
installation instructions.

----------
This is a plugin upgrade from v1.2 or 1.1. Just build and deploy
the new
files.

EJBCA V1.2
----------
This is a plugin upgrade from v1.1. Just build and deploy the
new
files.

EJBCA V1.1
----------

Upgrading from version 1.0:

If upgrading from version 1.0 the database tables need to be
migrated if the
DN attributes L or ST have been used. This is because the
ordering of those
attributes have changed (for string matching the order must be
defined).

If L or ST have not been used in DNs, migration is NOT needed.

What need to be done are to:
1. Read column with DN to me migrated from table.
2. Run 'newDN=CertTools.stringToBCDNString(oldDN)'.
3. Update column with DN in table.

Columns that need updating are:
issuerDN in table CRLData
subjectDN, issuerDN in table CertificateData
subjectDN in table UserData.

If a tool is needed to perform the migration, please contact us.
