UPGRADE
=======

This document describes procedures needed to upgrade from one 
version of EJBCA to a new version.
Upgrades within a major version, from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2 for example, are 
usually plug-in upgrades and can be made simply by deploying the new 
software. See doc/RELEASE_NOTES for info about such upgrades.

If you use the patch file to upgrade use a command like:
- Have old version of ejbca unzipped to directory ejbca.
- Go to directory ejbca and apply patch with:
- patch --strip=0 -u < ../patch-396_397.txt
(change name of patch file depending on which version you are upgrading)

After this you must do:
- ant clean
- ant deploy

All database upgrades require CREATE and ALTER TABLE privileges besides the regular SELECT, UPDATE,
INSERT and DELETE. The SQL executed by database upgrades code is available in
"src/upgrade/<oldversion>_<newversion>/<oldversion>_<newversion>-upgrade-<database>.sql".

From EJBCA 5.0.x to EJBCA 5.1.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 

Note for upgrade to 5.1.0:
In EJBCA 5.1.0 new versions of BouncyCastle jars are included. If you have been copying ejbca/lib/bc*.jar files to JBoss 
(jboss/server/default/lib), you must remove the old jars from JBoss and copy new jars from EJBCA.

The class CliAuthenticationToken and associated classes have been moved from the CLI module to reside next to the other 
authentication classes under src. This means that approval requests using the CliAuthenticationToken created in 5.0.x will not 
be forwards compatible.  

From EJBCA 5.0.x to EJBCA 5.0.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation (if not using ejbca-custom).
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

Note the possibility to use 'ejbca-custom' directory since EJBCA 3.5.x, this can simplify upgrades. 
See Admin Guide

Read RELEASE_NOTES carefully in order to see if any particular changes might effect your upgrade particularly.

If you get a "java.lang.NoSuchMethodError" in the admin GUI it is because JBoss does not clean temporary files very good.
Delete the directories JBOSS_HOME/server/default/tmp and JBOSS_HOME/server/default/work and restart JBoss to get it working.

Note for upgrade to 5.0.6:
In EJBCA 5.0.6 new versions of BouncyCastle jars are included. If you have been copying ejbca/lib/bc*.jar files to JBoss 
(jboss/server/default/lib), you must remove the old jars from JBoss and copy new jars from EJBCA.
 
From EJBCA 4.0.x to EJBCA 5.0.x
--------------------------------
Support for the old LogEntryData has been dropped in EJBCA 5.0 and is replaced by a new AuditRecordData. 
If you need to old audit records export the logs before upgrading. There is also a tool to export them after upgrade.
The new audit log function have the capability for audit record protection, at the same time as being cluster friendly. 

EJBCA 5.0 introduces a new access control mechanism that can provide more functionality and more well defined operations.
Some of the older access rules, such as the super administrator, has changed and needs to be modified in the post-upgrade step.
It is recommended that you verify that your access roles and rules after an upgrade.
 
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.
If you are upgrading a cluster, update the software on all the nodes.

1. Copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, use the ejbca-custom feature for easier upgrades, see User Guide.

2. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

3. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant bootstrap' with the new version.

4. Start up JBoss.

5. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME.
   This will upgrade access rules to rules that are compatible with the new access control system.

6. If you are running in a cluster, you should now upgrade (ant bootstrap) on all cluster nodes. 
   The newly deployed nodes should be running now.
   
7. Do 'ant post-upgrade' on one of the nodes.
   This will make the necessary database updates. 
   Note: On some application server you may have to upgrade the database manually, see below.
   This will also upgrade CertificateProfile objects and possible CA objects in the database.
   After this upgrade, it may not be possible to downgrade to EJBCA 4.0.x again. 

8. Stop JBoss, clear the tmp and work directories in the servers, then start JBoss again to flush all caches.

9. Go into the Admin GUI and verify you settings.

The database schema upgrade is normally done automatically for you when you run 'ant post-upgrade'. 
Some application servers will not let you deploy unless the database is in sync though (or your database user
may not have privileges for schema updates), so you may have to run the SQL commands manually. 
Check src/upgrade/400_500 to find the correct sql files(s) for your database.

A practical note is that when upgrading from EJBCA 4.0 you can not use the CLI in EJBCA 5.0 before you
have finished migrating all your 4.0 nodes and run post-upgrade.

NOTE:
If you need to downgrade EJBCA to 4.0.x again after a completed 'ant post-upgrade', you must add back the 
dropped database column (caId in AdminEntityData, value 0 is fine) in the database.
If should be possible to downgrade to 4.0.4 again after an 'ant post-upgrade' in EJBCA 5.0. 

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.11.x directly to 5.0.x, by following the same instructions
as above (this upgrade is not thoroughly tested though).

NOTE: Some configuration options in ejbca.properties has moved to cesecore.properties. You should migrate these configuration changes.
You will be warned during build if you are using these options and have not migrated them.

If you get a "java.lang.NoSuchMethodError" in the admin GUI it is because JBoss does not clean temporary files very good.
Delete the directories JBOSS_HOME/server/default/tmp and JBOSS_HOME/server/default/work and restart JBoss to get it working.

NOTE: You may see 'new' administrator roles after upgrade.
* DEFAULT - This role can be safely deleted. It was used internally by EJBCA.
* Public Web Users - This role can be safely deleted. It was used internally by EJBCA.
* Super Administrator Role - This role contains the ejbca cli user. If you remove rights for the ejbca user you will not be able to use the CLI.

Note for upgrade to 5.0.6:
In EJBCA 5.0.6 new versions of BouncyCastle jars are included. If you have been copying ejbca/lib/bc*.jar files to JBoss 
(jboss/server/default/lib), you must remove the old jars from JBoss and copy new jars from EJBCA.
 
From EJBCA 4.0.x to EJBCA 4.0.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation (if not using ejbca-custom).
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.

Read RELEASE_NOTES carefully in order to see if any particular changes might effect your upgrade particularly.

If you get a "java.lang.NoSuchMethodError" in the admin GUI it is because JBoss does not clean temporary files very good.
Delete the directories JBOSS_HOME/server/default/tmp and JBOSS_HOME/server/default/work and restart JBoss to get it working.

NOTE: In 4.0.7 the healthcheck URL for the VA, was changed. See conf/va.properties.sample for details how to reconfigure 
your healthcheck URL.

From EJBCA 3.11.x to EJBCA 4.0.x
--------------------------------
If you installed fresh on or upgraded to EJBCA 3.11.0 or EJBCA 3.11.1 on MySQL, start by reading
the next section before continuing.

Support for ProtectedLog that was deprecated in EJBCA 3.10.0 has been dropped. If you use this feature,
export the logs before upgrading. When the data from these tables are securely stored elsewhere or if
you never used this feature, these tables and indexes can be dropped.

Support for table protection (configured in proptecion.properties) that was deprecated in EJBCA 3.11
has now been dropped. If you don't have any data in these tables, the indexes and tables can be dropped.

EJBCA 4.0 requires an application server supporting JEE5. For JBoss this means at least JBoss 5.1.x.
For details on how the application server should be configured, see the installation document.

*Notes for on-line upgrades*
1. If you were running an earlier version of EJBCA on an older JBoss (4.2.3 was recommended for EJBCA 3.x), 
   *and* you need to do an on-line upgrade (upgrade one cluster node while another is running) you should 
   first upgrade your cluster to to running on JBoss 5.1.x before upgrading any of the cluster nodes to EJBCA 4. 
2. Configure "app.version.effective=3.11.x" in conf/ejbca.properties for all but the last node that you
   deploy with EJBCA 4.0.x. Comment out the property and redeploy the other nodes again. This will ensure that
   the JBoss serialization still works for the deployed EJBCA 3.11.x nodes during the migration.

The values of "customAvailableAccessRules" and "RNGAlgorithm" (Random Number Generator) are now configurable 
from conf/ejbca.properties instead of being read through the ENC.

The 'database.name' property in database.properties changed from mssql2000 to mssql for MS-SQL Server.
The 'database.url' property in database.properties no longer needs XML escaping for '&'-characters.
The 'ocsp-database.url' property in ocsp.properties no longer needs XML escaping for '&'-characters.

Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.
If you are upgrading a cluster, update the software on all the nodes.

1. Copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, use the ejbca-custom feature for easier upgrades, see User Guide.

2. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

3. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant bootstrap' with the new version.

4. Start up JBoss.

5. If you are upgrading on JBoss, do 'ant post-upgrade' on one of the nodes. This will convert all
   JBoss serialized objects into regular Java serialized objects and allow you to switch
   application server in the future.

6. Restart JBoss again to flush all caches.

7. Go into the Admin GUI and verify you settings.

New in EJBCA 4.0 is that we have a well defined database schema, that is functionally equal for all
supported databases. You can verify that your database schema is correct by comparing it to the SQL
table create script for your database ('doc/sql-scripts/create-tables-ejbca4-{database name}.sql').

Note: Some deprecated methods have been removed in 4.0. For example in the publisher API. If you used those methods
to create custom publishers you need to update your code to match the new interfaces. To make it easy there is only
new parameters that are not needed to use.

From EJBCA 3.11.0 or 3.11.1 to EJBCA 3.11.x
-------------------------------------------
Read RELEASE_NOTES carefully in order to see if any particular changes might effect your upgrade.

Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation (if not using ejbca-custom).
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

Note the possibility to use 'ejbca-custom' directory since EJBCA 3.5.x, this can simplify upgrades. 
See Admin Guide

* There is one issue that only affects installations upgraded to or freshly installed on EJBCA 3.11.0. 

The database mapping for KeyRecoveryData.certSN on _MySQL_ in 3.11.0 was wrong and can be corrected
by running:
    ALTER TABLE KeyRecoveryData MODIFY certSN varchar(80) binary NOT NULL DEFAULT '';

The database mapping for UserData.cardNumber in the table create script on _MySQL_ in 3.11.0 and
UPGRADE notes in 3.11.1 was wrong and can be corrected by running:
        ALTER TABLE UserData MODIFY cardNumber varchar(250) binary NULL DEFAULT NULL;

The database mapping for ServiceData.nextRunTimeStamp and runTimeStamp was inconsistent on _Sybase_
in 3.11.0 and can be corrected by running:
    ALTER TABLE ServiceData MODIFY nextRunTimeStamp DECIMAL(20,0) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE ServiceData MODIFY runTimeStamp DECIMAL(20,0) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;

From EJBCA 3.10.x to EJBCA 3.11.x
--------------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you should run the upgrade process with only one node running,
and then simply update the software on the other nodes.

1. Copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, use the ejbca-custom feature for easier upgrades, see User Guide.

2. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

3. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant bootstrap' with the new version.

4. Start up JBoss. You might see some errors during startup due to that the database is not upgraded yet.

5. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME. This will make the necessary database updates. 
   Note: On some application server you may have to upgrade the database manually, see below.

6. Do 'ant post-upgrade' to make sure the new database columns in table ServiceData are populated, 
   and add new database column to PublisherQueueData.

6. Restart JBoss again to flush all caches.

7. Go into the Admin GUI and verify you settings.

The database upgrade is normally done automatically for you when you run 'ant upgrade' and 'ant post-upgrade'. 
Some application servers will not let you deploy unless the database is in sync though, so you may have
to run the SQL commands manually. Check src/upgrade/310_311 to find the correct sql files for your database.

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.2.x directly to 3.11.x, by following the same instructions
as above (this upgrade is not thoroughly tested though). 
Also see instructions below for additional issues when upgrading all the way from a much older version. 
*This is very important, depending on your database version you may have to do some additional steps for some of the upgrades.*

From EJBCA 3.10.x to EJBCA 3.10.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation (if not using ejbca-custom).
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

Note the possibility to use 'ejbca-custom' directory since EJBCA 3.5.x, this can simplify upgrades. 
See Admin Guide

Read RELEASE_NOTES carefully in order to see if any particular changes might effect your upgrade particularly.

From EJBCA 3.9.x to EJBCA 3.10.x
--------------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you should run the upgrade process with only one node running,
and then simply update the software on the other nodes.

1. Copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, use the ejbca-custom feature for easier upgrades, see User Guide.

2. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

3. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant bootstrap' with the new version.

4. Start up JBoss. You might see some errors during startup due to that the database is not upgraded yet.

5. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME. This will make the necessary database updates. 
   Note: On some application server you may have to upgrade the database manually, see below.

6. Restart JBoss again to flush all caches.

7. Go into the Admin GUI and verify you settings.

8. Do 'ant post-upgrade' if you want "Enforce unique public keys" to check against old certificate
   (see below).


In EJBCA 3.10 some unused code related to the "protection.keyref" property in conf/protection.properties
has been dropped. This also means a small database change where the unused column TableProtectData.keyRef
is dropped. To see which database structural changes are made you can find the SQL commands for your
database in src/upgrade/39_310/39_310-upgrade-<<database name>>.sql.

Approvals that are pending during the upgrade process will be upgraded automatically. These are Java
Objects and cannot be upgraded manually using custom SQL. If you need to perform a manual SQL update
all pending approvals should be taken care of before the upgrade.

A quick fix for the LogEntryData table that was spread in the wild in 2005 will also be corrected in
this release. The column "comment" (or "comment_" on Oracle) will change name to "logComment" for all
databases. Since older versions of DB2 than 9.7 cannot rename columns, it requires a massive UPDATE
operation on this database. DB2 9.7+ users can alter src/upgrade/39_310/39_310-upgrade-db2.sql to use
"ALTER TABLE LogEntryData RENAME COLUMN comment TO logComment;" instead. For all other databases this
renaming will be handled automatically by "ant upgrade". Please note that logging to the OldLogDevice
will not work during this upgrade.

The database upgrade is normally done automatically for you when you run 'ant upgrade'. 
Some application servers will not let you deploy unless the database is in sync though, so you may have
to run the SQL commands manually.

The ProtectedLogDevice has been deprecated, since it's hard to configure right and extremely
inefficient. There are currently plans to create a LogDevice aiming at non-repudiation rather than
detection of missing log-entries.

The option to use a separate soft keystore for the internal OCSP responder is no longer available. The
upgrade will remove the soft keystore and OCSP requests will be signed directly by the CA signing
certificate (currently the default behavior). External OCSP installations are not affected.

To improve testing there is a new configuration option to allow changing used properties through Remote
EJB access using conf/ejbca.properties#ejbca.productionmode. Default is to not allow configuration
changes, but some of the development system tests will fail until this is allowed.

The External RA module is now a part of the main EJBCA bundle and uses JPA for persistence. DataSources
used by the workers are configured in conf/externalra.properties. Properties for each worker are configured
under Services in the Admin GUI. Also the external SCEP RA application is now built from the main bundle
and is configured in conf/scep.properties. The documentation is available as a part of the generated doc.
The API as such has not changed and old client should still work, but External RA workers in EJBCA have to
be reconfigured.

Note that this version contains an inevitable API change for custom extensions because 
the CA key used to sign certificates does not have to be the same as the currently active CA key.
If you have created any custom extensions Java classes, you must add:
"PublicKey caPublicKey" to the parameter list in the getValue method. The value does not have to be handled.

Two more checks are now done before adding a certificate. See
http://ejbca.org/userguide.html#Enforce%20unique%20public%20keys and
http://ejbca.org/userguide.html#Enforce%20unique%20DN
These checks are enabled on all CA:s that existed before the upgrading. It should not be any problem to
have them enabled (different users do not normally share same keys or subject DN) in most installations.
But if you know that your users shares subject DNs or keys with each other they could be disabled.

A new column in the database (subjectKeyId) for "Enforce unique public keys" is added when 'ant upgrade' is
executed. To check the public key in new certificates against certificates issued before the upgrade this
column has to be set (after upgrade all rows of the column is null). The columns is set by 'ant post-upgrade'
(see step 8 above). Please note that 'post-upgrade' might take some minutes if there are many certificates in
the database. After the upgrade, two new indexes for the enforcing uniqueness should be applied:

    create index certificatedata_idx9 on CertificateData(subjectKeyId,issuerDN);
    create index certificatedata_idx10 on CertificateData(subjectDN,issuerDN);

To be able to use the OCSP monitoring tool the 'subjectKeyId' column should be added to the External OCSP
responders, but it does not have to be populated. See src/upgrade/39_310/39_310-upgrade-<<database name>>.sql
for the exact syntax to use for your OCSP database.

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.2.x directly to 3.10.x, by following the same instructions
as above (this upgrade is not thoroughly tested though). Also see instructions below for additional
issues when upgrading all the way from a much older version.

If you are using some databases, specifically an older version of Derby, you may have to manually upgrade your database. See src/upgrade/39_310/39_310-upgrade-derby.sql.

From EJBCA 3.9.x to EJBCA 3.9.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation (if not using ejbca-custom).
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

Also note the possibility to use 'ejbca-custom' directory since EJBCA 3.5.x, see User Guide.

From EJBCA 3.8.x to EJBCA 3.9.x
-------------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you should run the upgrade process with only one node running,
and then simply update the software on the other nodes.

1. Copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, use the ejbca-custom feature for easier upgrades, see User Guide.

2. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

3. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant bootstrap' with the new version.

4. Start up JBoss. You will see some errors during startup due to that the database is not upgraded yet.

5. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME. This will make the necessary database updates. 
   Note: On some application server you may have to upgrade the database manually, see below.

6. Restart JBoss again to flush all caches.

7. Go into the admin-GUI and verify you settings.

In EJBCA 3.9 there are new possibilities for filtering certificates on certificateProfileId and tags. 
This requires a small database change. To see which database structural changes are made you can find 
the SQL commands for your database in src/upgrade/38_39/38_39-upgrade-<<database name>>.sql.
The database upgrade is normally done automatically for you when you run 'ant upgrade'. 
Some application servers will not let you deploy unless the database is in sync though, so you may have to run 
the SQL commands manually. The assigned certificateProfileId for each new CertificateData is default 0.
If you want to assign the last used certificateProfileId used for the same user you can manually execute
    UPDATE CertificateData SET certificateProfileId=(SELECT certificateProfileId FROM UserData
		WHERE CertificateData.username=UserData.username);
    UPDATE CertificateData SET certificateProfileId=0 where certificateProfileId is null;
but this will take a *very* long time for a large population.

EJBCA 3.9 also has a new table in the database. If you are using JBoss this is created automatically for you.
If you are using another application server, created the table in your database using the create statement for
the table PublisherQueueData from one of the create-tables scripts in doc/howto.
 
You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.2.x directly to 3.9.x, by following the same instructions
as above (this upgrade is not thoroughly tested though). Also see instructions below for additional
issues when upgrading all the way from a much older version.

Note! If you are using the external RA you need to upgrade to ExtRA 3.9 and follow upgrade instructions 
in the ExtRA package.

Note! If you have changed the 'tomcat' username for the JBoss SSL server certificate you should check the certificate profile used.
This is because the old ENDUSER certificate profile can no longer be used for SSL server certificates.
The corresponding upgrade sql in the normal upgrade script is:
update UserData set certificateProfileId=9 where username='tomcat' and certificateProfileId=1;

Note! If you are using an external OCSP responder using EJBCA's publishing from EJBCA to the responder, you need to update
the responders database table CertificateData using the SQL commands above.

Note! If you are using JBoss 5.x. Don't forget to copy new BC jars from EJBCA_HOME/lib/bc*.jar to JBOSS_HOME/server/default/lib, 
replacing to old ones that you copied there from the old version of EJBCA.

From EJBCA 3.8.x to EJBCA 3.8.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation (if not using ejbca-custom).
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

Also note the possibility to use 'ejbca-custom' directory since EJBCA 3.5.x, see User Guide.

From EJBCA 3.7.x to EJBCA 3.8.x
-------------------------------
Note that if using JBoss, you need JBoss 4.2.x or later to run EJBCA 3.8.x. 

From EJBCA 3.8.0 you are able to mix administrators from different CAs in the same Administrator
Group. This improvement requires a small database change.

The "Administrator" flag on end entities has been dropped, so if you match administrators on CN
and uses this to distinguish between admins and nonadmins, you should switch to using certificate
serial number or another unique identifier instead.

Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you should run the upgrade process with only one node running,
and then simply update the software on the other nodes.

1. Copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, use the ejbca-custom feature for easier upgrades, see User Guide.

2. Merge changes from *.properties.sample into your *.properties files.

3. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

4. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

5. Start up JBoss. You could see some errors during startup due to that the database is not upgraded yet.

6. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME. This will make the necessary database updates. 
   Note: On some application server you may have to upgrade the database manually, see below.

7. Go into the admin-GUI and verify you settings.

8. Restart JBoss again to flush all caches.


Ant upgrade is needed to make the database changes in the authorization module.
To see which database structural changes are made you can find the SQL commands for your database in
src/upgrade/37_38/37_38-upgrade-<<database name>>.sql. Note that ant upgrade does more than these sql lines.

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.1.x directly to 3.8.x, by following the same instructions
as above (this upgrade is not thoroughly tested though). Also see instructions below for additional
issues when upgrading all the way from a much older version.

If an upgrade option for your database is not included, take a look in src/upgrade/37_38 where upgrade 
sql scripts are located. We will happily include upgrade scripts for other databases as well. 

From EJBCA 3.7.x to EJBCA 3.7.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation (if not using ejbca-custom).
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

Also note the possibility to use 'ejbca-custom' directory since EJBCA 3.5.x, see User Guide.

From EJBCA 3.6.x to EJBCA 3.7.x
-------------------------------
Upgrade from EJBCA 3.6.x to 3.7.x is a plug-in upgrade.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you should run the upgrade process with only one node running,
and then simply update the software on the other nodes.

1. Copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, use the ejbca-custom feature for easier upgrades, see User Guide.

2. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

3. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant bootstrap' with the new version.

4. Start up JBoss.

5. Go into the admin-GUI and verify you settings.

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.1.x directly to 3.7.x, by following the same instructions
as above, but answering yes to the second question (this upgrade is not thoroughly tested though).
Also see instructions below for additional issues when upgrading all the way from a much older version.

If you are using PrimeCardHSM you need to upgrade to a new version, matching EJBCA 3.7.

From EJBCA 3.6.x to EJBCA 3.6.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

Also note the possibility to use 'ejbca-custom' directory in EJBCA 3.5.x, see User's Guide.

From EJBCA 3.5.x to EJBCA 3.6.x
-------------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

Upgrade from EJBCA 3.5.x to EJBCA 3.6.x requires one small database change.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you should run the upgrade process with only one node running,
and then simply update the software on the other nodes.

1. Copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, use the ejbca-custom feature for easier upgrades, see User Guide.

2. Merge changes from *.properties.sample into your *.properties files.

3. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

4. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant bootstrap' with the new version.

5. Start up JBoss. You could see some errors during startup due to that the database is not upgraded yet.

6. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME. This will make the necessary database updates. 
   If you are upgrading from EJBCA 3.4 or 3.5, answer 'no' to the second and third question.
   Note: On some application server you may have to upgrade the database manually, see below.

7. Go into the admin-GUI and verify you settings.

8. Restart JBoss again to flush all caches.


If you don't want to do step 6 above (doing step 6 is the recommended way though) and instead want to do the upgrade 
of the database manually, you can simply issue the following sql command:
MySQL: 
  alter table CRLData add deltaCRLIndicator int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT -1;
PostgreSQL: 
  alter table CRLData add deltaCRLIndicator INT;
  update CRLData set deltaCRLIndicator = -1;
  alter table CRLData alter column deltaCRLIndicator set not null;
  alter table CRLData alter column deltaCRLIndicator set default -1;
Oracle: 
  alter table CRLData add deltaCRLIndicator NUMBER(10) default -1;

If you are using another application server than JBoss, you need to create new tables in the database 
manually. Create the new tables ProtectedLogData, ProtectedLogExportData and ProtectedLogTokenData from
one of the database scripts in doc/howto/create-tables-xxx.sql.

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.1.x directly to 3.6.x, by following the same instructions
as above, but answering yes to the second question (this upgrade is not thoroughly tested though).
Also see instructions below for additional issues when upgrading all the way from a much older version.

If an upgrade option for your database is not included, take a look in src/upgrade/35_36 where upgrade 
sql scripts are located. We will happily include upgrade scripts for other databases as well. 

The JBoss Mbean create CRL service has been removed in EJBCA 3.6. It has been replaced with the much easier, 
more portable etc CRL Update Service configured in the Admin-GUI. See the User Guide about CRL creation for details.

If you are using PrimeCardHSM you need to upgrade to a new version, matching EJBCA 3.6.

Note. In EJBCA 3.6 we changed the case of some database column to get full Sybase compatibility. This will not affect
other database (in that case you would have had problems already), but it can be good to know.
Column cases changed for most columns in ApprovalData, for cAId in LogEntryData, and for cAId in ProtectedLogData.  

From EJBCA 3.5.x to EJBCA 3.5.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

Also note the possibility to use 'ejbca-custom' directory in EJBCA 3.5.x, see User's Guide.

From EJBCA 3.4.x to EJBCA 3.5.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 

EJBCA 3.5 is a plug-in upgrade from EJBCA 3.4.x. A few steps are still needed for upgrade though.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

The new root-less install on linux systems makes it much easier to have control of you Java truststore 
(which CAs that are allowed for administrator certificates) both on linux and windows. 
You must make these steps during upgrade on both linux and windows:
- copy $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts $EJBCA_HOME/p12/truststore.jks
- ant clean; ant deploy

In EJBCA 3.5 when you run the command 'ant javatruststore' or 'ant -Dca.name=MyCAName javatruststore' it is now 
the file $EJBCA_HOME/p12/truststore.jks that will be updated and copied to $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/keystore. 

You should also read about the new external merge directory 'ejbca-custom', where you can collect all your 
own files. See 'Handling changes in a separate tree' in the User's guide.

There are some parameter name changes in ejbca.properties and web.properties. 
These parameters are only used when freshly installing EJBCA though. If you plan to do this using
old configuration files, you should merge changes from ejbca.properties.sample and web.properties.sample.
No worry if you forget though, since you will be prompted for the values instead.

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.1.x directly to 3.5.x, by following the same instructions for database 
upgrade as for EJBCA 3.4.

From EJBCA 3.4.x to EJBCA 3.4.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply copy conf/*.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes (if there are any) from *.properties.sample into your *.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

From EJBCA 3.3.x to EJBCA 3.4.x
-------------------------------
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

Upgrade from EJBCA 3.3.x to EJBCA 3.4.x requires one small database change.

If you are upgrading a cluster, you should run the upgrade process with only one node running,
and then simply update the software on the other nodes.

1. Copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation into the conf directory of the new release.
   Or better yet, split up your ejbca.properties file to match the new improved conf structure.

2. Merge changes from *.properties.sample into your *.properties files.

3. Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation. 

4. Shut down JBoss and do 'ant deploy' with the new version.

5. Start up JBoss. You will see some errors during startup due to that the database is not upgraded yet.

6. Issue the command 'ant upgrade' from EJBCA_HOME. This will make the necessary database updates. 
   If you are upgrading from EJBCA 3.2 or 3.3, answer 'no' to the second question.
   Note: On weblogic you have to upgrade the database manually, see below.

7. Go into the admin-GUI and verify you settings, specially verify the DN encoding in 'Edit Certificate Authorities' 
   as noted below.

8. Restart JBoss again to flush all caches.


If you don't want to do step 6 above (doing step 6 is the recommended way though) and instead want to do the upgrade 
of the database manually, you can simply issue the following sql command:
MySQL: 
  alter table CAData add updateTime bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
PostgreSQL: 
  alter table CAData add updateTime INT8;
  update cadata set updateTime = 0;
  alter table cadata alter column updateTime set not null;
  alter table cadata alter column updateTime set default 0;
Oracle: 
  alter table CAData add updateTime NUMBER(19) default 0;

Note: Since the default DN encoding changed to UTF8, there is an option in the CA configuration (Edit Certificate authorities)
called 'Use PrintableString encoding in DN'. Checking this checkbox causes the old behaviour to be used, using PrintableString as the default
encoding. The upgrade process tries to guess how this value should be set (upgrading an old CA we usually want to keep the old behaviour).
After the upgrade process, check your CA configuration to verify that the option is set to your liking.

Note: If you intend to use the XKMS service or the CMS service (log signing), then you should go into the Admin-GUI 
after upgrading and press the button "Republish CA Certificates" for all CAs. 
Otherwise you will not be able to revoke the certificates issued to these services, or view the certificates in the GUI.

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.1.x directly to 3.4.x, by following the same instructions
as above, but answering yes to the second question (this upgrade is not thoroughly tested though).

From EJBCA 3.3.x to EJBCA 3.3.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes (if there are any) from ejbca.properties.sample into your ejbca.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

From EJBCA 3.2.x to EJBCA 3.3.x
-------------------------------
Upgrade from EJBCA 3.2.x to EJBCA 3.3.x is a plug-in upgrade, because there are
no database changes, or the database changes are only new tables and not changed ones.

You should still follow this advice:
Backup your database first! If the upgrade fails, you can always go back to the earlier version.

Simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes from ejbca.properties.sample into your ejbca.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

You should be able to upgrade from EJBCA 3.1.x directly to 3.3.x, by following the same instructions
as when upgrading from 3.1.x to 3.2.x (untested though).

If you are using Eracom HSM, please notice that property names have changed for determining which key is used.
After upgrading EJBCA, you must go into CA configuration and update your HSM properties.
The property names are now the same for all different HSMs.

From EJBCA 3.2.x to EJBCA 3.2.x
-------------------------------
See release notes for details between certain versions. 
Normally upgrades within a major release are plug-in upgrades.

Simply keep/copy ejbca.properties from the earlier installation.
Merge changes (if there are any) from ejbca.properties.sample into your ejbca.properties.
Copy the directory 'p12' from the earlier installation and 'ant deploy' 
(or deploywithjbossservice) this new one.

From EJBCA 3.1.x to EJBCA 3.2
-----------------------------
Support for this upgrade is no longer available from EJBCA 3.9.x. Please use the latest EJBCA
release from the 3.8-branch as a first step if you need to upgrade from all the way from here.
