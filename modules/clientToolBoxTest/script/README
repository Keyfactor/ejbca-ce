This file is located in the root directory of the clientToolBoxTest distribution.
You should NOT be in this directory when you are running tests since some files
are created in the current directory that will be obsolete after the test.
There are 2 scripts that could be used to start the test; test.sh, run.sh

test.sh
=======
Run one or several test suites.
An EJBCA with the the domain name 'ca' must exist for most suites. An exception
is the 'PKCS11HSMKeyTool' suit.

run.sh
======
First created a docker container providing an EJBCA with the domain name 'ca'.
test.sh is started after jboss in the container is up and running. The container
is removed when test.sh exits.

Documentation
=============
Read ./doc/index.html to learn what is tested and how.
