/**
 * CertificateProfileData was one of the old classes that used serialized binary data in a blob in the database.
 * In order for CertificateProfileData.getProtectString to produce a String, the object was read in and then the
 * getData() method returned a LinkedHashMap. StringBuilder.build() called toString() on the LinkedHashMap, which
 * in turn called toString() on the objects in it. One of the objects was an ApprovalRequestType. In ECA-6518 the
 * toString() method was overridden in this enum, causing the string representation to be different. This caused
 * rowProtection signature verification to fail when you upgraded from a version <=6.11 to a version >=6.12.
 *
 * The aim of Eca7277CertificateProfileData is to fix this problem. Eca7277CertificateProfileData behaves exactly
 * like CertificateProfileData, but replaces any faulty substrings found in the protect string returned by
 * getProtectString() before returning it to the caller.
 *
 * This class, the regression test and all references to these can be safely removed when we are sure that all
 * installations have performed a post-upgrade on EJBCA version 7.x or later.
