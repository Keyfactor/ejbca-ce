/**
 * Represents the OCSP Archive Cutoff extension described in RFC6960, section 4.4.4.
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 *  An OCSP responder MAY choose to retain revocation information beyond
 *  a certificate's expiration.  The date obtained by subtracting this
 *  retention interval value from the producedAt time in a response is
 *  defined as the certificate's "archive cutoff" date.
 *  <p>
 *  OCSP-enabled applications would use an OCSP archive cutoff date to
 *  contribute to a proof that a digital signature was (or was not)
 *  reliable on the date it was produced even if the certificate needed
 *  to validate the signature has long since expired.
 *  <p>
 *  OCSP servers that provide support for such a historical reference
 *  SHOULD include an archive cutoff date extension in responses.  If
 *  included, this value SHALL be provided as an OCSP singleExtensions
 *  extension identified by id-pkix-ocsp-archive-cutoff and of syntax
 *  GeneralizedTime.
 *  <p>
 *    <code>id-pkix-ocsp-archive-cutoff OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-pkix-ocsp 6}</code>
 *    <br/>
 *    <code>ArchiveCutoff ::= GeneralizedTime</code>
 *  <p>
 *  To illustrate, if a server is operated with a 7-year retention
 *  interval policy and status was produced at time t1, then the value
 *  for ArchiveCutoff in the response would be (t1 - 7 years).
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * It is also used in ETSI EN 319 411-2 as follows:
 * <blockquote>
 *    CSS-6.3.10-08 [CONDITIONAL]: If OCSP is provided, the OCSP responder should use
 *    the ArchiveCutOff extension as specified in IETF RFC 6960 [i.9], with the archiveCutOff 
 *    date set to the CA's certificate "valid from" date.
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * This extension was enabled in ocsp.properties by setting the property <code>ocsp.expiredcert.retentionperiod</code>.
 * As of EJBCA 7.3, it is instead enabled per OCSP key binding, and can be configured to use either a specified retention
 * period or the <code>notBefore</code> date of the issuer.
