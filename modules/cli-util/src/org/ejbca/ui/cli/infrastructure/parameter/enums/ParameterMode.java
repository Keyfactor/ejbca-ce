/**
 * This enum declares the four types of CLI inputs possible. These are:
 *      ARGUMENT
 *          A switch and an associated value following that switch. The switch should never be alone, but the value may be if the parameter is 
 *          declared standalone.
 *      FLAG
 *          A switch without a following input value, such as --verbose
 *      INPUT
 *          Like an argument, but the value is expected to be prompted instead of read from the command line.
 *      PASSWORD
 *          Like INPUT, but the input is never echoed on the screen.
 *      HIDDEN
 *          A very special purpose type used to not show the parameter in the help text output. 
 *          See ECA-6787 for details.
