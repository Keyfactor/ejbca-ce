    This build file checks for the removed properties, ant targets etc. Checks
    made inside of this build script should fail hard (i.e. error-out as soon as
    possible) so the user is forced to update his/her property files etc.

    Once the item has been deprecated in one release, in the next release it
    should be moved here from the deprecated list.
