# EJBCA PKI [![Discuss](https://img.shields.io/badge/discuss-ejbca-ce?style=flat)](https://github.com/Keyfactor/ejbca-ce/discussions) 

EJBCA covers all your needs – from certificate management, registration and enrollment to certificate validation. 

Welcome to EJBCA – the Open Source Certificate Authority (software). EJBCA is one of the longest running CA software projects, providing time-proven robustness, reliability and flexibitlity. EJBCA is platform independent and can easily be scaled out to match the needs of your PKI requirements, whether you’re setting up a national eID, securing your industrial IoT platform or managing your own internal PKI for Enterprise or DevOps. 

EJBCA is developed in Java and runs on a JVM such as OpenJDK, available on most platforms such as Linux and Windows. 

There are two versions of EJBCA: 
* **EJBCA Community** (EJBCA CE) - free and open source, OSI Certified Open Source Software
* **EJBCA Enterprise** (EJBCA EE) - commercial and Common Criteria certified 

OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.
