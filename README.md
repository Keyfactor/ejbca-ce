## Welcome to the EJBCA Community

EJBCA is a public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authority (CA) solution and one of the longest-running CA software projects. It is platform-independent and covers the full certificate lifecycle, from enrollment and management to validation.

EJBCA is developed in Java and runs on a JVM such as OpenJDK, available on most platforms, such as Linux and Windows. 

There are two editions of EJBCA: 

*  **[EJBCA Community](https://www.ejbca.org/)** (EJBCA CE)

EJBCA Community Edition is an LGPL-licensed open-source subset of EJBCA Enterprise, certified by the Open Source Initiative, and designed for learning, testing, and prototyping certificate and PKI workflows. 

EJBCA CE is not intended for production use, as production deployments typically require security certifications, high assurance features, SLAs, support, and operational assurances  available in EJBCA Enterprise. 

*  **[EJBCA Enterprise](https://www.keyfactor.com/products/ejbca-enterprise/)** (EJBCA EE)

EJBCA Enterprise Edition is designed for production PKI deployments, offering advanced features, security certifications, high assurance features, enterprise-grade operations, and commercial support with SLAs.
