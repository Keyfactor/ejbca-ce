# Configuration file for running the system tests on a less standard setup (e.g. when using a proxy in front of EJBCA)
#

# Resolvable target hostname or IP of the external interface of EJBCA
# Normally this overrides "127.0.0.1" or "localhost" in the tests.
#target.hostname=192.168.5.181

# Target http port of the external interface of EJBCA
# Normally this overrides "8080" in the tests.
#target.port.http=80

# Target (dual authenticated) https port of the external interface of EJBCA
# Normally this overrides "8443" in the tests.
#target.port.https=443

# Full path to the PKCS#11 library 
pkcs11.library=/usr/lib64/libsofthsm2.so

# The security provider the specified library and slot results in 
pkcs11.provider=SunPKCS11-libsofthsm2.so-slot0

# By which methods we usually prefer to reference a slot. 
# Must be one of SLOT_NUMBER, SLOT_INDEX or SLOT_LABEL 
pkcs11.slottype=SLOT_INDEX

# The value of the slot type
pkcs11.slottypevalue=i0

# The PIN of the slot referenced by the pkcs11.slottypevalue.* properties. 
pkcs11.slotpin=userpin1


# Some tests test a specific way of referencing the PKCS#11 token.
# To run these tests (Pkcs11WrapperTest and Pkcs11SlotLabelTest currently), you need to set the following properties.
# If a token cannot be reliably referenced in a specific way (e.g. token number), you can leave that property commented out or blank.
pkcs11.token_number=1
pkcs11.token_label=ejbca
pkcs11.token_index=i1
