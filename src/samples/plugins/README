This directory contains a couple of sample plugins that can be used as
a starting point for building "real" EJBCA plugins.  Real plugins should
preferably be managed outside of the EJBCA source tree.

By performing

    ant deploy -Dejbca.plugin.conf.path=ABSOLUTEPATHTOEJBCA/src/samples/plugins

all the sample plugins will be added to EJBCA without any configuration.

A subsequent "ant deploy" will restore EJBCA in its unextended state.

The file EJBCA/conf/plugins/plugin.properties.sample describes how
a plugin build gets access to the core EJBCA environment.
