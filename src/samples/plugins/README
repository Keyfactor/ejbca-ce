This directory contains a couple of sample plugins that can be used as
a starting point for building "real" EJBCA plugins.  Real plugins should
preferably be managed outside of the EJBCA source tree.

By performing

    ant build -Dejbca.plugin.conf.path=ABSOLUTEPATHTOEJBCA/src/samples/plugins

all the sample plugins will be added to ejbca.ear without any configuration.

Deploy EJBCA with the plugins using:
    ant deployear
Check server.log of the application server to verify that everything deployed correctly.
The plugin webapp will be available at http://localhost:8080/ejbca/pluginweb/

A subsequent "ant build deployear" will restore EJBCA in its unextended state.

The file EJBCA/conf/plugins/plugin.properties.sample describes how
a plugin build gets access to the core EJBCA environment.
